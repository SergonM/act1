<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the preeminent non-viral drug delivery vehicle for mRNA-based therapies. Immense effort has been placed on optimizing the ionizable lipid (IL) structure, which contains an amine core conjugated to lipid tails, as small molecular adjustments can result in substantial changes in the overall efficacy of the resulting LNPs. However, despite some advancements, a major barrier for LNP delivery is endosomal escape. Here, we develop a platform for synthesizing a class of branched ILs that improve endosomal escape. These compounds incorporate terminally branched groups that increase hepatic mRNA and ribonucleoprotein complex delivery and gene editing efficiency as well as T cell transfection compared to non-branched lipids. Through an array of complementary experiments, we determine that our lipid architecture induces greater endosomal penetration and disruption. This work provides a scheme to generate a class of ILs for both mRNA and protein delivery.</p><p>Since the discovery of mRNA in 1961 1 , there has been a push to develop mRNA-based medicines for protein replacement therapy 2 and vaccines 3 due to the numerous advantages that mRNA has over traditional therapeutics. This includes the ability to encode any protein by designing a corresponding mRNA sequence, lower dosage as a single strand can be translated into many copies of the therapeutic protein, and inability for mRNA to integrate into the genome 4 . Still, despite these advantages, the first FDA approval of an mRNA drug was in 2020</p></div>

The lag in clinical success is due to the difficulty in delivering mRNA as it rapidly degrades in the bloodstream, is unable to cross plasma membranes unaided due to the inherent negative charge, and can trigger unwanted immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . While advances in nucleic acid modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and purification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> have produced less immunogenic RNAs, the clinical translation of mRNA is also a result of synergy with nanotechnology, particularly lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are the most clinically advanced non-viral drug carrier for nucleic acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . LNPs protect mRNAs from degradation and immune recognition by enshrouding them in a lipid shell and can help guide mRNAs to specific locations. The safety and efficacy of LNPs has been previously validated as they are utilized in both the Moderna (Spikevax) and Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) mRNA COVID-19 vaccines <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . LNPs have also advanced the field of gene editing through the delivery of mRNAs encoding for Cas9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and base editors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . While previous drug delivery vehicles have had limited success in inducing efficacious and safe editing, LNPs have mediated gene editing for hemophilia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , hypercholesterolemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , and glioblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</p><p>The canonical LNP is composed of cholesterol, a PEGylated lipid, a phospholipid, and an ionizable lipid (IL), with the latter being the most essential component for mRNA delivery. ILs strike a delicate balance between ionization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , which facilitates the encapsulation of mRNA into the LNP, and hydrophobicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , which allows the lipid to be imbedded into the particle. Additionally, ILs influence LNP tropism as they facilitate the formation of a protein corona in vivo, where these proteins assist in guiding the LNP to its destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Moreover, ILs expedite endosomal escape, or the process of mRNAs breaking through the endosome and entering the cytosol to be translated into functional protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Endosomal escape is one of the most significant barriers in nucleic acid drug delivery, as recent studies have shown that while many nanoparticles can enter cells, only a few individual particles can escape the lysosomal degradation pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</p><p>There are no formal criteria for designing effective ILs, although the majority contain at least one amine and several lipid tails. Most of the research on IL structure has been dedicated to investigating different amine cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , lipid tail lengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , and lipid unsaturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . These optimized ILs are often designed for specific applications, such as liver delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , intramuscular delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , targeting specific immune cell populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and ocular delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , and thus the generalizability of these trends have not been robustly evaluated. One structural factor that is found among many of the top-performing ILs, including all of the FDA-approved ILs, is the role of lipid branching <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Lipid chains near the amine core that branch into smaller lipid chains are hypothesized to enhance endosomal escape by forming a cone-shaped structure upon binding to the endosomal phospholipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . These cone shapes reorganize the lipid bilayers, allowing the nucleic acid cargo to escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . More recently, it was found that installing branched groups at the termini of the lipid chains, rather than near the amine, can greatly enhance mRNA transfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . These studies suggest that lipid architecture can enhance mRNA delivery; however, a significant barrier that has prevented further exploration and structure-function analysis of IL architecture, especially for lipids with terminal-branched groups, is the lack of structurally diverse lipid starting materials. As a result, only a handful of branched lipids are available to test. Additionally, while there are synthetic methods available to access newer lipids, they are tedious, often requiring expensive reagents and extensive multi-step reactions, and are only applicable for a subset of amine cores.</p><p>To explore the phenomenon of terminally branched lipid architecture more intently, we develop a facile, affordable, and modular synthetic approach to generate lipids of various lengths with different forms of terminal branching. We demonstrate that these ILs can enhance mRNA transfection and Cas9-mediated gene editing. Through an array of assays, we show that terminal branching enhances the ability of the ILs to undergo endosomal escape. Finally, we determine that these ILs can also improve hepatic Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex delivery as well as enhance T cell transfection, showcasing the versatility of these lipids. The compounds, which are named Branched ENdosomal Disruptor (BEND) ILs, represent a potential advancement in the field of LNP-mediated drug delivery and gene editing, as they provide a lipid design criterium that is based on robust mechanistic studies and can be utilized for both mRNA and protein cargo delivery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis of BEND ILs and formulation into LNPs</head><p>ILs can be generated in one step by reacting a monoamine or polyamine with lipids containing electrophilic handles such as epoxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . This allows for the rapid production of libraries of ILs by simply mixing different amine cores with epoxides of various lengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . Therefore, we developed a scheme to synthesize epoxides with any desired length and terminal branching that could then be further reacted with polyamine or monoamine reagents to produce ILs with greater structural variability. To achieve this, we first coupled primary bromoalkenes with branched caps via copper-catalyzed Grignard C-C coupling to produce branched alkenes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Primary bromoalkenes are common reagents and are used to establish the different lengths of the epoxides; however, they become more expensive as the chain length increases. Longer bromoalkenes can be generated by reacting the less expensive terminal dibromoalkanes in a mono E2 reaction with tertbutoxide, which we demonstrated by synthesizing 12-bromododec-1ene in moderate yield. Numerous Grignard caps are commercially available due to their wide use in other synthetic avenues and are utilized in this scheme to establish the branched group. Following this step, the branched alkenes were converted into the corresponding branched epoxides via mCBPA-mediated epoxidation. The C-C coupling and epoxidation steps can be completed together in less than 24 h, demonstrating the ease of this method. In this study, twelve branched epoxides were synthesized, which consisted of isopropyl, tert-butyl, and sec-butyl branching groups at four different lipid lengths.</p><p>To form ILs, epoxides underwent an S N 2 reaction with 2-(2-aminoethoxy)-N-(2-(4-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)ethan-1-amine (494) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). We have employed the 494 polyamine core to generate ILs and the corresponding LNPs for CAR T-cell therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , in utero mRNA delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , and delivery to the placenta <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and thus this core represents an interesting structural motif. Overall, twelve BEND ILs were synthesized in only three days. As controls, four linear ILs of the same relative lipid length as the branched library were also synthesized using the same S N 2 reaction. In total, sixteen ILs were synthesized. The nomenclature of the BEND ILs is based on "AXb-C", where "A" is the electrophilic moiety of the lipid tail, "b" is the branching type, "C" is the lipid core number, and "X" is the linker length or number of methylene units between A and B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). The branching abbreviations are "i" for isopropyl, "t" for tert-butyl, and "s" for sec-butyl, whereas for the reactive electrophile, "E" refers to epoxide. Non-branched ILs utilize their historical name.</p><p>ILs were formulated into LNPs utilizing herringbone microfluidic devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , using a standard molar ratio of 35:16:46.5:2.5 of the IL, 18:1 Δ9-cis phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), cholesterol, and 14:0 PEG2000 phosphoethanolamine (C14-PEG 2000 ), respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . Since all LNPs were constructed using the same excipient molar ratio as well as cholesterol and the same phospholipid and PEGylated lipid, the only difference between each LNP formulation is the structure of the IL. Thus, we hypothesized that any increase in efficacy of the BEND system is due to the propensity of these ILs to increase endosomal escape compared to linear ILs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>). For consistency, each LNP was named after the corresponding IL. The LNPs encapsulated firefly luciferase (FLuc) mRNA at a 10:1 weight ratio of IL and mRNA, and were characterized for encapsulation efficiency, size, ζ-potential, and pK a      (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-d</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Although multiple parameters were evaluated, there were no noticeable differences between the LNPs with linear, isopropyl, tert-butyl, and sec-butyl ILs. All LNPs have &gt;80% encapsulation efficiency and sizes ranging from 70-160 nm with average polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 0.2. The ζ-potentials of the LNPs ranged from 5.57 to -28.1, indicating that most have neutral or a slightly negative charge. Lastly, the majority of the LNPs have a pK a around 6.0. mRNA delivery is enhanced in vivo by BEND ILs LNP efficacy was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Each LNP was evaluated for transfection in HeLa cells by incubating the LNPs at a dose of 20 ng of FLuc mRNA per 20,000 cells for 24 h. The luminescence results indicated that BEND ILs enhanced LNP transfection at the shortest and longest lipid lengths by as much as 10-fold, whereas in the middle lengths, branching induced either no significant change or decreased transfection (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). When examined for toxicity, none of the LNP-treated groups had less than 80% cell viability (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). LNPs were then administered intravenously into C57BL/6J mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. C12-200, a gold standard and potent liver-tropic IL with a structurally similar polyamine core as 494, was formulated into LNPs and injected to serve as a positive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . After 12 h, full body and organ luminescence were obtained. LNPs with BEND 494-core ILs performed as well as or better than the corresponding LNPs with linear ILs for lipid lengths of C8, C10, and C12, whereas C14 BEND ILs performed slightly worse. For full body delivery, six LNPs with BEND 494-core ILs and only one LNP with a linear 494-core IL induced comparable total flux to C12-200, whereas E4t-494 and E6t-494, and no linear LNPs, outperformed C12-200 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). All LNPs transfected the liver preferentially over other organs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), and in terms of liver total flux, six LNPs with BEND 494-core ILs performed similarly or better than C12-200, with E4i-494 facilitating 1.5-fold greater total flux (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>). Notably, no LNPs with linear 494-core ILs achieved equal or greater liver luminescence than C12-200.</p><p>We then investigated whether installing branched epoxides on the N 1 -(2-(4-(2-aminoethyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (200) polyamine core could achieve superior liver delivery, as this core is more liver-tropic than the 494 core. As such, six of the branched epoxides were coupled with the 200 core to form six BEND ILs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>). The successful synthesis of the branched 200-core ILs underscores the robust nature of the initial epoxide design as it can be applied to other amine cores. The isopropyl, tert-butyl, and sec-butyl groups were each evaluated at relative lipid lengths of eight carbons and twelve carbons, and the corresponding linear versions, C8-200 and C12-200, were utilized as controls. While the C12-200 is the aforementioned gold standard IL, C8-200 has reduced mRNA delivery and thus represents an important test as to whether branching can also convert this IL into a potent liver-tropic LNP. These eight ILs were then formulated into LNPs with FLuc mRNA and characterized using the same methodology as described above. No notable differences in the physicochemical parameters were observed between LNPs with BEND 200-core ILs and LNPs with linear 200-core ILs, which is consistent with the characterization data for the LNPs with 494-core ILs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Testing in HeLa cells showed conflicting trends, as C8-200 performed better or the same as the BEND equivalents while E8i-200 and E8s-200 LNPs outperformed C12-200 2-3-fold (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>). Similar to the 494-core LNPs, none of the LNPs demonstrated toxicity in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>). Afterwards, the 200-core LNPs were intravenously injected into C57BL/6J mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of FLuc mRNA. As controls, the Moderna SM-102 and Pfizer/BioNTech ALC-0315 vaccine formulations were also evaluated. All BEND 200-core LNPs achieved greater full body total flux (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) and liver total flux (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6c</ref>) than C12-200, SM-102, and ALC-0315, with E4s-200 inducing five-fold greater liver signal. Additionally, to probe kinetics, C12-200 and E8i-200 were injected into C57BL/6J mice and liver luminescence was analyzed after 6 h. Similar to the 12 h timepoint, the BEND LNP had higher mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). While branching seems to enhance liver delivery in general, lipid length also plays an important role. For example, while E4s-200 is the most potent IL in this library, E8s-200 has only a 3-fold increase in liver total flux compared to C12-200. However, isopropyl groups achieve more consistent gains in delivery than tert-butyl and sec-butyl groups, with both E4i-200 and E8i-200 outperforming C12-200 by 4-fold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEND LNPs induce potent gene editing</head><p>Next, we evaluated BEND LNP gene editing in a murine model for transthyretin (TTR)-mediated amyloidosis. TTR is a protein that when overexpressed in the liver, will develop into amyloid fibrils that can induce restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure. LNP-based siRNA therapies such as ONPATTRO® have been utilized to silence TTR translation in the liver; however, this can require multiple transfusions as siRNA has a limited therapeutic window <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . Instead, delivering gene editing machinery can offer a single dose therapy that permanently reduces TTR to safe levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . To test this, the eight LNPs with 200-core ILs were reformulated to encapsulate Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting TTR. C57BL/6J mice were then intravenously injected at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg of combined Cas9 and TTR sgRNA. After seven days, blood was removed, serum was isolated, and the levels of TTR protein were evaluated compared to serum isolated from the same mice 24 h before the injections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>). Mice were sacrificed following blood withdrawal, and the livers were removed, underwent DNA isolation, and were analyzed for genomic insertions or deletions (indels) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). While C12-200 reduced TTR levels by 80%, four of the LNPs with BEND ILs reduced TTR levels by 80-90% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>). These latter LNPs induced 60-70% indels, while C12-200 only induced 55% indels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3f</ref>). It is notable that C8-200 induced TTR reduction below 10%, whereas the LNPs with BEND C8 ILs facilitated significant TTR reduction and indels, signifying that small molecular alterations in lipid structure can lead to substantial changes in LNP efficacy. The correlation between gene editing levels and TTR reduction cannot solely be ascribed to the IL alone as there are downstream biochemical pathways that also impact the secretion of hepatic proteins, and those may be affected due to LNP delivery. Still, the important therapeutic factor is TTR reduction and thus the LNPs with 200-core BEND ILs induce an enhanced effect compared to the linear versions. These results demonstrate that BEND ILs can enhance delivery of multiple types of mRNAs, highlighting the potential universality of this design. To probe the potential harmful effects of BEND LNPs, the liver toxicity markers AST (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3g</ref>) and ALT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3h</ref>) were examined 12 h after the Cas9/sgRNA injections. Interestingly, the LNPs exhibited different degrees of toxicity that depended on the branched group and lipid length. For example, E4s-200 and E8t-200 had lower AST levels than C12-200 but higher ALT values, whereas E8s-200 had the opposite effect. However, the LNPs with isopropyl ILs, E4i-200 and E8i-200, exhibited much lower AST and ALT levels than C12-200, suggesting that these LNPs could have translational potential due to their high efficacy and low toxicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LNP physicochemical characteristics and liver targeting are minimally altered by BEND ILs</head><p>To understand the mechanism of the increased efficacy of BEND ILs, we evaluated several factors that influence LNP trafficking to the liver. Initially, we determined whether lipid branching results in LNPs with optimal physicochemical parameters by correlating the liver total flux of each LNP, from the studies with FLuc mRNA, with particle size, PDI, ζ-potential, pK a , encapsulation efficiency, and performance in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a-g</ref>). None of these parameters were predictive of successful liver delivery, with size and PDI having the highest Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.516 and -0.465, respectively. The lowest predictor was ζ-potential with a correlation coefficient of 0.0651, likely because the LNPs all have a relatively neutral surface charge. HeLa cell transfection was also a poor predictor of in vivo delivery, having a correlation coefficient of -0.0725, which is consistent with other studies demonstrating poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo data for systemic delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> . This is likely due to the differences in biological environments, where in vivo factors such as the circulatory system, immune system, and unique proteins within blood, combined with the physical forces within the bloodstream, can cause LNPs to have altered efficacy compared to their in vitro trends. Following this study, we assessed whether the morphology of BEND LNPs differed from linear LNPs; however, upon analyzing the structures via cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), C8-200 and BEND versions had a similar egg-shaped morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4h</ref>), whereas the C12-200 and BEND versions had a rounder structure with multiple lipid layers, likely due to the longer lipid chains (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). This suggests that these BEND ILs have minimal impact on the global arrangement of LNPs, although this does not exclude the possibility of finer changes in bilayer and mesophase arrangement. We then investigated LNP stability by incubation in PBS and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C. LNP size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4i-j</ref>) and PDI (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>) was measured every hour for 24 h by dynamic light scattering immediately after incubation. No instability was measured in either PBS or DMEM, and in the latter, all LNPs formed a similar sized protein corona with a total diameter of approximately 170 nm. This suggests that both BEND LNPs and linear LNPs behave similarly in physiologically relevant conditions.</p><p>Since particle physicochemical characteristics, morphology, and stability seemed to be unaffected by terminal lipid branching, we then investigated the role of liver trafficking and uptake. Protein corona formation was further investigated by injecting E4i-200, E4t-200, E4s-200, and C12-200 FLuc LNPs into apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Upon measuring liver total flux after 12 h, all four LNPs had decreases in total flux of 100-1000-fold compared to wildtype mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4k</ref>). Therefore, mRNA LNPs with both BEND and linear ILs target the liver via an ApoE-mediated mechanism, as has been demonstrated with other liver-tropic LNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . Studies have suggested that IL structure can also impact the specific liver cells that uptake LNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . For example, Kupffer cells are liver macrophages that more favorably phagocytose certain types of LNPs 49 . To investigate the role of Kupffer cells, we injected C57BL/6J mice with clodronate liposomes, which deplete macrophages. After 24 h, the mice were injected with the eight LNPs with 200-core ILs encapsulating FLuc mRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4l</ref>). Liver luminescence was measured 12 h later, showing that all LNPs except for C8-200 had decreased luminescence resulting from the lack of LNP uptake and transfection in Kupffer cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4m</ref>). This suggests that branching is not a major factor in the ability of macrophages to uptake LNPs. More likely, it is possible that lipid length is more of a determinant as C8-200 and E4i-200, the two LNPs with ILs containing the fewest number of carbon atoms, had the smallest changes in liver total flux; although, a larger library would need to be screened to validate this trend. Finally, we analyzed particle accumulation in the liver to study the influence of LNPs without factoring mRNA translation. LNPs containing FLuc mRNA were reformulated with 1 mol% DiR, a lipophilic carbocyanine near IR fluorescent dye. Fluorescent LNPs were injected into C57BL/6J mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of FLuc mRNA, and the major organs were dissected and imaged for fluorescence after 12 h. Here, fluorescence is a marker of LNP accumulation. While mRNA transfection and translation had occurred primarily in the liver, LNP fluorescence was observed in the liver and spleen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4n,</ref><ref type="figure">o</ref>). More interestingly, the linear and BEND LNPs showed no significant difference in liver fluorescence, suggesting that regardless of IL structure, these LNPs accumulate in the liver at roughly the same levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEND ILs facilitate greater endosomal escape</head><p>Since the eight LNPs with 200-core ILs accumulate in the liver at relatively the same amounts, but the LNPs with BEND ILs induce greater mRNA translation, we hypothesized that this result is due to the BEND ILs enhancing endosomal escape. To verify this, we studied the interactions of the eight LNPs with 200-core ILs with artificial endosomes, a previously validated strategy to study the role of endosomal escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . Artificial endosomes were formulated via thin film hydration of DOPE, 18:1 Δ9-cis phosphocholine (DOPC), 18:1 phospho-L-serine (DOPS), NBD-conjugated 18:1 phosphoethanolamine (NBD-PE), and Lissamine-Rhodamine-B-conjugated 18:1 phosphoethanolamine (Liss-Rhod-PE) at a molar ratio of 48:25:25:1:1, respectively. The latter two lipids are a FRET pair that were used to monitor the integrity of the endosomes. Increases in the fluorescence of the donor fluorophore corresponds to endosomal disruption due to the separation of the FRET pair. In this study, each LNP was diluted 6X in pH 5.5 buffer to represent endosomal conditions and mixed with the artificial endosomes. At various timepoints, fluorescence of the donor fluorophore was measured. For these experiments, we separated the LNPs to factor out the influence of lipid length and examine the role of terminal branching. LNPs with BEND ILs induced 2-to-3-fold greater fluorescence than the LNPs with linear ILs for the C8-200, E4i-200, E4t-200, and E4s-200 (C8/E4x 200-core) LNPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>) as well as the C12-200, E8i-200, E8t-200, and E8s-200 (C12/E8x 200-core) LNPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>) groups, supporting the idea that lipid branching, in general, can enhance endosomal disruption. Similar trends were also observed for the C8-494, E4i-494, E4t-494, and E4s-494 (C8/E4x 494-core) LNPs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10a</ref>).</p><p>To gain molecular level insight into this phenomenon, we also performed atomistic molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to model IL penetration into a bilayer with similar composition to the model endosomal bilayer. Whereas the FRET experiments measured rupturing via the LNPs, here, we examined how a single IL molecule interacts with the lipid bilayer for each of the eight 200-core ILs. Initially placed 4 nm above the bilayers, ILs quickly become inserted into the membrane within the first 200-500 ns. The mean vertical distance between the center of mass of the bilayer and that of the IL was measured after 0.5 µs of the trajectory. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, the E4x-200 BEND ILs all showed substantial increases in bilayer penetration in comparison to C8-200, with E4t-200 and E4s-200 having &gt;0.2 nm decrease in the distance to the bilayer center, which is a substantial distance considering the lipid bilayer itself is ~5 nm. For the C12/E8x-200 ILs, both E8t-200 and E8s-200 penetrated the lipid bilayer by 0.1 nm more than C12-200, whereas E8i-200 showed an equivalent distance. When plotted against each other, the artificial endosomal rupturing and IL penetration data align (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), showcasing that these are complementary studies that can investigate both LNPs and the corresponding ILs. Snapshots of the atomistic MD simulations show that BEND IL lipid tails are more able to fully extend into the bilayer, whereas the linear IL tails reside closer to the phospholipid surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>). E4x-494 BEND ILs also demonstrated greater penetration than C8-494 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10b-d</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEND ILs enable liver-tropic CRISPR-Cas9 RNP delivery</head><p>LNPs have had tremendous success advancing RNA therapeutics, whereas the efficacy of protein delivery with LNPs is substantially lower. Thus, we assessed whether the properties of BEND ILs can enhance LNP-mediated RNP complex gene editing in the liver, as endosomal escape is also a major barrier for protein delivery. While proteins are more difficult to encapsulate due to their sensitive tertiary structure, there is also a lack of advancement in developing ILs that increase protein delivery. As such, we took the top three performing BEND ILs, E4i-200, E4s-200, and E8i-200, and tested their ability to edit Ai9 mice in comparison to C12-200, using Cas9 RNP complexes. These LNPs were prepared in 1X PBS for the aqueous phase and using DOTAP to facilitate encapsulation of the negatively charged RNP complex into the particles, as using low pH citrate buffer can denature proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . Utilizing herringbone microfluidic devices, Cas9 RNP LNPs were formulated with the corresponding IL, DOPE, cholesterol, C14-PEG 2000 , and DOTAP at a molar ratio of 10:11.5:30:1:16, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref>).

After seven days from the last injection, the mice were sacrificed and the lungs, liver, and spleen were imaged. All three BEND The schematic is shown in l. Mice were sacrificed and dissected after 36 h post injection of clondronate liposomes and m liver total flux was measured via IVIS. Total flux is reported as mean + SD of n = 3. C57BL/6J mice were injected with the eight LNPs with the 200-core ILs containing 1 mol% DiR and after 12 h, mice were sacrificed and liver n fluorescence and o images were collected. Total radiant efficiency is reported as mean + SD of n = 3 for E4i-200, E4t-200, E4s-200, and C12-200, and n = 6 for all other LNPs. k, m Two-sided multiple unpaired t tests with post hoc Holm-Šídák correction for multiple comparisons were used to compare the total flux of control groups with treatment groups across each LNP. n One-way ANOVA with post hoc Student's t tests using the Holm-Šídák correction for multiple comparisons was used to compare total radiant efficiency across treatment groups to C12-200. For k, m, liver luciferase data is used from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. l was created in BioRender. Hamilton, A.

In contrast, C12-200 induced 1.5X greater lung fluorescence than any of the BEND LNPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6d</ref>). Minimal spleen editing was observed, with E4s-200 exhibiting some spleen fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>). We then measured the liver:lung ratio for each of the four LNPs and found that all BEND LNPs had higher liver editing compared to lung editing, suggesting that the BEND ILs alter the tropism of LNPs encapsulating Cas9 RNP complexes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). This is in contrast with the mRNA LNPs that selectively target the liver, showing that the inclusion of DOTAP and the Cas9 RNP complex increase lung delivery for LNPs with linear ILs but not for LNPs with BEND ILs. After processing and analyzing the liver for editing (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>), cell-specific tropism was also identified. E4s-200 induced &gt;10% hepatocyte editing, twice as much as C12-200 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>). Additionally, E8i-200 facilitated 40% editing of CD326+ epithelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>), twice as much as the other LNPs, but had 5% editing in CD45+ immune cells, which was half the editing of the other three LNPs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">13</ref>). Meanwhile, all LNPs had around 15% editing for CD31+ endothelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6k</ref>). Lastly, we characterized the RNP LNPs for size, PDI, ζ-potential, Cas9 encapsulation, and sgRNA encapsulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6l</ref>). There were no major differences between the four LNPs. While Cas9 protein encapsulation (37-42%) was much lower than RNA encapsulation (100%), this is due to differences in the assay measurements. The micro-BCA kit measures total encapsulation, factoring in the original amount of protein lost during formulation. Instead, RiboGreen assays measure relative encapsulation and does not factor in RNA loss during formulation.</p><p>While we have demonstrated that BEND ILs can enhance hepatic endosomal escape and thus could increase liver gene editing using RNPs, there are other mechanisms we have not explored that could also aid in reduced lung and enhanced liver editing. This includes the role of the RNPs themselves, as cargo has been found to influence tropism and efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> , as well as the potential for different protein corona binding due to the presence of the BEND ILs <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> . For the latter, we incubated the four RNP LNPs with human vitronectin, a protein found in lungs during inflammation, conditions consistent with DOTAP-mediated lung accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . We found that only E8i-200 had significant increases in size when mixed with the protein, indicating IL hydrophobicity, rather than IL branching, may play a role in vitronectin binding as this IL has the most number of carbon atoms out of the four ILs tested (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEND platform boosts T cell transfection</head><p>To demonstrate the potential of this platform for non-liver related applications, we evaluated the ability of LNPs with BEND ILs to transfect T cells. As our lab has previously demonstrated that LNPs containing ILs with the 494 polyamine core can potently deliver mRNA to T cells, we endeavored to evaluate our LNPs with BEND 494-core ILs in a similar manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . We incubated the twelve LNPs with BEND 494-core ILs and the corresponding four LNPs with linear 494-core ILs containing FLuc mRNA in activated 1:1 CD4+ and CD8+ human primary T cells obtained from healthy adult donors. Similar to the hepatic delivery results, all BEND LNPs performed as well as or better than their linear versions, while simultaneously inducing similar or lower toxicity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). While C8-494 induced substantial toxicity, the LNPs with BEND variants had little toxicity, while facilitating significantly higher luminescence. Notably, E4t-494 and E4s-494 were among the top performers, and a higher luminescence compared to C10-494, despite having the same number of atoms, further validating the necessity of evaluating lipid architecture. Overall, isopropyl structures, except for those with C6 linkers, increased luminescence by 3-10 fold compared to the linear versions. Excluding the shortest C4 linker, none of the tert-butyl and sec-butyl moieties induced greater luminescence than the linear controls. Still, the top five LNPs all incorporated BEND ILs. As our lab has also created an optimized LNP formulation for T cell transfection, we tested whether producing BEND LNPs with altered lipid ratios would also increase LNP efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . This formulation, B10, which utilizes less cholesterol and more DOPE, was found to be optimal when incorporating C14-494 as the IL (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7c</ref>). We reformulated the top performers from the FLuc mRNA screen utilizing the B10 ratio with mCherry mRNA and examined the percentage of transfected T cells via flow cytometry. Two LNPs with BEND ILs, E4s-494 B10 and E8i-494 B10 , performed as well as C14-494 B10 by transfecting ~70% of cells. Additionally, the E4t-494 B10 LNP had markedly lower mRNA transfection of 30%. We theorize that since the B10 recipe is specifically optimized for the C14-494 IL, these ratios of excipients may not enhance, and possibly decrease the potency of, other ILs. This also means that the BEND ILs can benefit from further optimization. E10i-494 B10 emerged as a top performer, transfecting over 80% of T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15</ref>). Intriguingly, the E10i-494 IL has the same lipid length as C14-494 but has isopropyl groups instead of a linear chain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7f</ref>).</p><p>We probed whether these results are due to increased endosomal escape, as we had demonstrated with hepatic LNP delivery. We reformulated the top performing LNPs using the B10 ratios encapsulating Cy3-labeled EGFP mRNA and included SM-102 as a positive control. Flow cytometry was used to assess GFP expression and Cy3 uptake at 24 h after LNP incubation in human primary activated T cells. We found that after 24 h, almost 100% of T cells were Cy3+, indicating that LNPs are entering almost every cell (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7g</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">16</ref>). Moreover, the E8i-494 B10 and E10i-494 B10 LNPs facilitated two-fold and fourfold greater GFP translation than the C14-494 B10 LNP, respectively, whereas E8s-494 B10 performed similarly and E4t-494 B10 had the lowest transfection of ~4%, on par with SM-102. The differences in mRNA translation from the GFP and mCherry experiments are likely due to the addition of the Cy3 tag on the GFP mRNA strand, which can lower transfection efficiency. Due to the difference in E10i-494 and C14-494 ILs being a single methyl group on each lipid chain, we further investigated the corresponding LNPs via confocal microscopy. Both LNPs were reformulated with Cy3-GFP mRNA and 1 mol% DiR and incubated in activated primary human T cells for 4 h. Then, we analyzed colocalization of the Cy3-labeled mRNA in endosomes, with the latter visualized via LysoTracker Deep Red. We found that E10i-494 B10 induced around 20% less colocalization than C14-494 B10 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7h-i</ref>). DiR colocalization was not evaluated due to its tendency to stay within phospholipid membranes. While increased endosomal escape is likely a dominant factor in BEND ILs inducing greater mRNA signal, it is possible that the BEND ILs and LNPs have enhanced ionization at endosomal pH as has been demonstrated with other branched-like lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . However, there is only a small difference in the pK a of each LNP. Additionally, using MolGpka, we calculated the pK a of the conjugate acid of the C14-494 and E10i-494 ILs, and they both were 8.4-9.0 depending on the specific nitrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . More experiments will be needed to determine the role of ionization in the BEND platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>LNP efficacy is directly related to the chemical structures of the lipid excipients, especially the IL, which facilitates cargo encapsulation, organ tracking, cellular tropisms, and endosomal escape. Most studies investigating IL structure are restricted to commercially available lipids. Unfortunately, most of these lipids are linear, and while some branched lipids are available, they are restricted to specific groups and lipid lengths. Additionally, efforts to generate lipids with structural variety are often expensive and synthetically laborious. Thus, we introduced a method using inexpensive and widely available reagents to rapidly generate lipids with greater architectural diversity that can be produced at most lipid lengths. By utilizing this scheme, we incorporated different terminal branching groups onto the lipids to probe the structure-function relationships of linear and non-linear ILs in LNP delivery. In general, these BEND ILs can enhance LNP-mediated transfection for both mRNA and protein delivery in the liver. Moreover, when applied to gene editing cargo and T cell delivery, the BEND LNPs improved hepatic editing with Cas9 mRNA and Cas9 RNP complex as well as total T cell transfection.</p><p>Mechanistic understanding of IL structures is essential to advance the LNP field. However, due to the complexity of LNPs, it is important to perform a wide array of studies to probe different explanations. We underwent thorough testing and determined that BEND ILs minimally impact LNP physicochemical characteristics and structure, whereas liver trafficking depends on the cargo. Instead, we demonstrated that lipid branching more likely enhances endosomal escape through a combination of artificial endosome studies and MD simulations. Specifically, the MD simulations showcase, with increased resolution, how BEND ILs penetrate membranes more deeply than linear ILs. It is important to note that the endosomal escape studies are limited by the simplicity of the models, as biological endosomes are composed of a complex milieu of lipids and proteins that undergo a dynamic endosomal maturation process. Thus, our results aim to establish coarse endosomal escape trends based on branching, which is why it is necessary to separate the E4x and E8x lipids so that the role of lipid length does not confound the analyses. While these data do not perfectly represent the in vivo liver delivery results, they do demonstrate the broader trend of terminal branching in enhancing mRNA transfection. The optimal branching moiety depended on the biological application, lipid length, and polyamine core, although the aggregated results showcase that terminal branching facilitates similar or better LNP transfection regardless of the moiety. For example, for the 200core LNPs, all three forms of branching induced higher FLuc mRNA transfection, whereas for the 494-core, ILs with smaller lipid lengths benefited more from the three branched groups. To identify structure-activity relationships it will be necessary to expand the range of terminal branched structures as well as develop more complex endosomal models. We envision that this synthetic methodology and mechanistic characterization regime can be utilized as a template to generate the next-generation of ILs for more efficacious LNP-mediated delivery of biotherapeutics.</p></div>
