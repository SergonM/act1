<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cancer immunotherapy that deploys the host's immune system to recognize and attack tumors, is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, its efficacy is greatly restricted by the immunosuppressive (i.e., immunologically cold) tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we report an in-situ cryo-immune engineering (ICIE) strategy for turning the TME from immunologically "cold" into "hot". In particular, after the ICIE treatment, the ratio of the CD8 + cytotoxic T cells to the immunosuppressive regulatory T cells is increased by more than 100 times in not only the primary tumors with cryosurgery but also distant tumors without freezing. This is achieved by combining cryosurgery that causes "frostbite" of tumor with cold-responsive nanoparticles that not only target tumor but also rapidly release both anticancer drug and PD-L1 silencing siRNA specifically into the cytosol upon cryosurgery. This ICIE treatment leads to potent immunogenic cell death, which promotes maturation of dendritic cells and activation of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells as well as memory T cells to kill not only primary but also distant/metastatic breast tumors in female mice (i.e., the abscopal effect). Collectively, ICIE may enable an efficient and durable way to leverage the immune system for combating cancer and its metastasis.</p><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and metastatic cancer is the major reason for cancer-related mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . Harnessing the immune system to battle cancer via immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful and potentially revolutionizing strategy for treating cancer metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Although therapeutic advances with tumor antigen vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and other cancer immunotherapy strategies have shown promising success in both pre-clinical and clinical studies of hematological malignancies, their efficacy of destroying solid tumors in most cancer patients has been limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . The immunosuppressive (i.e., immunologically cold) tumor microenvironment (TME) including malignant cells, deactivated/ compromised immune cells, and soluble factors, is a key factor that contributes to the poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy of solid tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</p><p>Cryosurgery has been proposed as a promising strategy to modulate the TME in cancer treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> . Cryosurgery is done by cooling to cause ice formation (i.e., frostbite) in tumor, which leads to cryoinjury and cancer cell death inside the frozen tissue iceball <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .

These molecules may provoke immunogenic cell death (ICD), shape an immuno-active (i.e., immunologically hot) TME, and further stimulate dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, as well as CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to execute antitumor immunotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> . In addition, unlike high-temperature thermal therapy for which vascular stasis occurs during heating, there is a temporary (a few hours) reperfusion of the tumor immediately after thawing a frozen tumor iceball <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> , which may allow efficient immune cell infiltration into the tumor after cryosurgery. However, cryosurgery alone is insufficient to stimulate a potent immunotherapeutic effect against cancer.</p><p>Cryosurgery has been used clinically and become increasingly popular for treating cancers, particularly for breast cancer. This is because it is minimally invasive with minimized cosmetic damage compared to conventional surgery with a scalpel, and the frozen tumor iceball can be conveniently monitored in real-time using medical ultrasonography due to the hyperechoic nature of ice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . Unfortunately, a temperature of -20 °C or below is required to ensure cell death while the temperature in the peripheral region of a frozen tumor iceball detectable by medical ultrasonography is above -20 °C and up to ~-4 °C17-20,36,37 . The latter is because biological tissues freeze gradually with the decrease of temperature starting from ~-0.6 °C to below -20 °C during cryosurgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and the extent of ice formation is insufficient for detection (based on the aforementioned hyperechoic property of ice) by medical ultrasonography until ~-4 °C. In other words, medical ultrasonography can neither detect ice formation above ~-4 °C nor tell where the temperature is below -20 °C that is needed to ensure cancer cell death. This may lead to incomplete tumor destruction and cancer recurrence after cryosurgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . Therefore, combining cryosurgery with other cancer therapies has been explored to improve cancer-killing in the peripheral region of a frozen tumor iceball for enhanced therapeutic outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> . However, despite the efficacy of destroying localized tumors with the combination therapies, their capability of effectively killing distant and metastatic tumors (i.e., the abscopal effect of cryoimmunotherapy) has not been reported in the literature. Furthermore, no work has been done to utilize nanotechnology (particularly the one that is responsive to the cold/ freezing temperature during cryosurgery) for delivering immunotherapy to combine with cryosurgery for enhancing the efficacy and safety of cancer therapy.</p><p>Here we report an in-situ cryo-immune engineering (ICIE) approach to turn the TME from immunologically cold into hot, by developing a type of cold-responsive nanoparticles (CRNPs) to codeliver chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents for combining with cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This not only greatly enhances cancer cell killing at the edge of a frozen tumor iceball with a high subzero temperature (from ~-4 to -20 °C) that alone can not kill cancer cells effectively, but also stimulates cryo-immunotherapy against both the primary tumor with the cryosurgery treatment and distant/metastatic tumors with no cryosurgery. Taken together, ICIE may be a strategy for reversing the immunosuppressive TME to generate potent tumor-specific immune responses against not only primary but also distant and metastatic tumors with no evident side effects. This is of great significance as cancer metastasis is the major cause of most cancer-related mortality.</p><p>In-situ Cryo-Immune Engineering (ICIE) of an immunologically "hot" tumor microenvironment (TME) Cryosurgery Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> | A schematic illustration of the ICIE strategy for killing both primary and distant/metastatic tumors. ICIE combines cryosurgery with intravenously injected (i.v.) irinotecan (or camptothecin/CPT) and PD-L1 silencing siRNA (siR)-laden cold-responsive nanoparticles (CPT&amp;siR CRNPs) to engineer the tumor microenvironment (TME), via promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and reducing the expression of programmed death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer cells. This turns the TME from immunologically "cold" (i.e., immunosuppressive) into immunologically "hot" (i.e., immuno-active). As a result, the CD8 + T cells can be activated to exert tumor eradication both locally and systemically. The CPT&amp;siR CRNPs are prepared by a double-emulsion method detailed in the Methods section using CPT, siR, Poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly (N-isopropylacrylamide copolymerized butyl acrylate) (pNIPAAm-BA), chitosan-modified PF-127 (CS-PF-127), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), and sodium chloride (NaCl). HMGB1: high mobility group box protein 1, CRT: calreticulin, HSP-70: heat shock protein-70, HSP-90: heat shock protein-90, DC: dendritic cell, and T EM : effective memory T cell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Synthesis and characterization of CRNPs for cold-triggered drug and gene release</p><p>Previous studies used polymers with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of ~14-30 °C to synthesize thermally responsive nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , which can not be used to precisely control the drug and gene release within the frozen tumor iceball while sparing the surrounding normal tissue in response to the cold temperature (~-4 °C) at the outer surface of an iceball during cryosurgery. Therefore, we synthesized a series of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide copolymerized with butyl acrylate) (pNIPAAm-BA) polymers with varying LCSTs by adjusting the feeding ratio of NIPAAm to BA. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy analyses of chemical bonds show successful synthesis of the pNIPAAm-BA polymers (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). The number-averaged molecular weight (M n ) ranges from ~67 to 83 kDa as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). The LCST of the polymers dispersed in different solutions was measured with cryo-microscopy.</p><p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, the LCST of the same polymer displays no significant variation in different solvents/solutions, but a higher NIPAAm content leads to a higher LCST of the pNIPAAm-BA polymer. The resultant p(NIPAAm) 589 -co-(BA) 117 , with an LCST of -4.4 ± 0.6 °C that is close to the temperature on the outer surface of a frozen tumor iceball, was selected to synthesize the CRNPs for coencapsulating irinotecan (CPT, a clinically used chemotherapy drug) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) silencing siRNA (siR) using a double-emulsion method (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Other materials used for synthesizing the CRNPs include poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), Pluronic F127 (PF127), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), and chitosan. Most of the materials are either FDA-approved for medical use (PLGA, PF127, and DPPC) or naturally derived material (chitosan) with good biocompatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> , which may facilitate the clinical translation of the CRNPs. The surface of the resultant CPT&amp;siR-laden CRNPs (or CPT&amp;siR CRNPs for short) is decorated with chitosan (CS) for enhanced tumor-targeting capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</p><p>To optimize the loading of CPT and siR in the CRNPs, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading content (LC) of CPT were measured for feeding CPT at 1, 3, and 5% of the polymers. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, the EE of CPT decreases monotonically with the increase of the CPT feeding percentage, while the LC of CPT reaches a plateau at 3% feeding percentage. Therefore, the 3% CPT feeding percentage was used in this work, for which the LC of CPT is 1.5 ± 0.2% with an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 51.2 ± 8.2%. For siR, the EE and LC are 73.4 ± 4.2% and 0.14 ± 0.01%, respectively. The particle size of the optimized CPT&amp;siR CRNPs is 143.6 ± 6.6 nm in diameter with a surface zeta potential of -4.9 ± 0.4 mV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs shows that they have a core-shell structure (at 22 °C with no cooling, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). Furthermore, they are stable over time and show negligible changes in their size after being suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for five days (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>). Moreover, compared to the free siR that easily gets degraded within 5 minutes of incubation with PBS at 22 °C (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>), the siR encapsulated in the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs remains stable for at least 24 h (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>).</p><p>The cold-responsiveness of the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs was studied by TEM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) first. As shown in the TEM and SEM images in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, destruction of the structure of the CRNPs after cold treatment (incubating the samples at -4 °C for 10 min and warming back to 22 °C) is evident. The cold-induced destruction of the CRNP structure can trigger the release of the encapsulated siR, resulting in an evident band (white) of siR in agarose gel for the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with the cold treatment at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>). The hydrodynamic diameter of the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs is greatly increased with two wide peaks (one at ~700 nm and the other at ~5000 nm on average) after the cold treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>), probably due to aggregation of the hydrophobic polymers/drugs dissembled from the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs. According to the photographs and cryomicroscopy images of the nanoparticle samples in deionized water (DW, 12.0 mg ml -1 , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), the aqueous sample of CPT&amp;siR-laden poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (CPT&amp;siR PLGA NPs, 135.7 ± 6.1 nm in diameter with a surface zeta potential of -14.1 ± 0.6 mV) that are not cold-responsive, has a homogeneous and milky appearance and blocks light to give a dark cryo-microscopic image at both 22 °C (either before or after cooling) and -4 °C. In contrast, a homogeneous and transparent aqueous sample can be observed for the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs at -4 °C, although the sample is also homogeneous and milky at 22 °C before the cooling treatment. The cryo-microscopic images showing the cold-triggered changes were further analyzed to quantify their grayscale intensity. When slowly cooled (1 °C min -1 ) below ~4 °C, the sample of the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs becomes more and more transparent with lower and lower grayscale intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>). In comparison, the grayscale intensity of the microscopic images for the sample of the CPT&amp;siR PLGA NPs remained constant during cooling. When warmed back to 22 °C, the sample with CPT&amp;siR CRNPs becomes heterogeneous with a large whitish aggregate of insoluble materials piling up at the bottom (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>). These results confirm the cold-triggered dissolution and irreversible disassembly of the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs.</p><p>To determine the cold-triggered drug release profile, the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs were incubated in different buffers at pH 5.0, 6.5, and 7.4 to mimic that in lysosomes, the extracellular space of tumor, and normal tissue, respectively. Before applying the cold treatment, both CPT and siR are released in a sustained manner at 37 °C, with less than 10% release in 8 h (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b-d</ref>). After cold treatment by incubating the samples at -4 °C for 10 min, cold-triggered rapid release profiles are observable for both CPT and siR in all three different buffers, due to the cold-induced disassembly of the CRNPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cold-triggered endo/lysosomal escape of siR and enhancement of PD-L1 silencing</head><p>To investigate cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of the CRNPs, CRNPs loaded with CPT and cyanine 5 (Cy5)-labeled siR were incubated with green fluorescent protein-positive EO771 (GFP + EO771) breast cancer cells and lymphocytes from mouse spleen at 37 °C for 8 h. Significant red fluorescence signal of Cy5 can be observed in the GFP + EO771 cells with confocal microscopy, indicating successful uptake of the CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs by the cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>). In contrast, negligible Cy5 fluorescence could be detected in the cells incubated with free CPT and Cy5-siR, probably due to degradation and/or poor uptake of the siR. Successful cellular uptake of the CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs is confirmed by flow cytometry, which shows over 90% of the GFP + EO771 cells are Cy5 positive (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). For non-cancerous cells like lymphocytes isolated from the spleen, only ~0.9% of them are Cy5 positive (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>), suggesting the good cancer cell targeting capability of the CRNPs. We further investigated if cold treatment of CRNPs in cells can trigger endo/lysosomal escape of the siR into the cytosol. Without cold treatment (CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs), Cy5 fluorescence can be observed in the endo/lysosomes of EO771 cells after 8 h of incubation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>), indicated by the evident overlap of Cy5 (red) and endo/lysosomes (green) as shown by the confocal images, the distribution of the red and green fluorescence intensities, and the high intensity of Cy5-siR fluorescence in the endo/lysosomal areas. After cold treatment (CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs+C), colocation of Cy5 and endo/lysosomes is decreased with an evident separation of red and green fluorescence signals, indicating successful cold-triggered escape of Cy5-siR from endo/lysosomes into the cytosol. The cold-triggered enhancement of endo/lysosomal escape is due to the encapsulation of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the CRNPs. In EO771 cells treated with the CRNPs containing no NaCl, cold treatment (CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs+C, no NaCl) does not induce an evident separation between the red fluorescence of Cy5-siR and the green fluorescence of endo/lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). The underlying mechanism for NaCl-induced endo/lysosomal escape may be ascribed to the rapid release of the encapsulated Na + and Cl - into the endo/lysosomes triggered by cold treatment, resulting in a surge of osmolality (hypertonicity) and influx of water to destabilize or rupture endo/lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . As a result, the encapsulated CPT and PD-L1 silencing siRNA are rapidly released into the cytosol to perform the chemotherapy and gene silencing functions.</p><p>To investigate the gene silencing effect of CRNPs-delivered siR, we incubated GFP + EO771 cells with CRNPs containing GFP silencing siRNA (GFP-siR CRNPs) for 8 h, cold-treated the cells at -4 °C for 10 min, and further cultured them for 40 h. The cold-triggered GFP-siR release from the CRNPs markedly decreases the expression of GFP in the GFP + EO771 cells, according to the data of confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>) and flow cytometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f-g</ref>). Without cold treatment, GFP fluorescence is eliminated in ~26% of GFP + EO771 cells treated with the GFP-siR CRNPs. After cold treatment of the cells incubated with GFP-siR (CRNPs+C), the percent of cells with silenced GFP expression increases to ~95%, indicating cold-triggered siR release and its capability of effectively silencing GFP expression in the cells. This is further confirmed by treating EO771 cells with CRNPs loaded with siR specific for silencing PD-L1. Cold-triggered release of the PD-L1 silencing siR from CRNPs (PD-L1-siR CRNPs+C) results in a much lower expression of PD-L1 in EO771 cells (2.5%) than the treatments of free PD-L1 siR and PD-L1-siR CRNPs without cooling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>). These results indicate that the cold-triggered siR release from CRNPs significantly enhances their gene-silencing ability.</p><p>To evaluate the anticancer capacity of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs, EO771 cells were incubated with blank CRNPs, free CPT&amp;siR, and CPT&amp;siR CRNPs at various CPT concentrations for 24 h with and without cold treatment. CPT&amp;siR CRNPs show significantly higher efficacy to kill the cancer cells than free CPT&amp;siR (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>), probably due to poor cellular uptake of free CPT&amp;siR. Importantly, cold treatment further significantly enhances the efficacy of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs to kill cancer cells, showing the cold-triggered rapid release of CPT is more effective in killing cancer cells than the slow and sustained release of CPT from the nanoparticles. It is worth noting that the viability of cells treated with the blank CRNPs (up to 5.6 mg ml -1 ) is higher than ~90%. The cancer cell killing efficacy of cold-treated CPT&amp;siR CRNPs at a CPT concentration of 10.0 µg ml -1 is further confirmed by flow cytometry data, showing a high percentage of apoptosis/necrosis (77.9%) in EO771 cells with the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs+C treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE increases the expression of DAMPs and maturation of DCs</head><p>We next studied the impact of ICIE (i.e., the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs+C treatment) on ICD via examining the expression of DAMPs and maturation of DCs. For cold treatment, EO771 cells were incubated with the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs or other control formulations including PBS, free CPT&amp;siR, CPT-laden CRNPs (CPT CRNPs), and PD-L1 silencing siR-laden CRNPs (siR CRNPs) for 8 h, cold-treated at -4 °C or -20 °C for 10 min, and further cultured for 16 h. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the expression of DAMPs in the cells, including heat shock protein-90 (HSP-90), heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70), calreticulin (CRT), and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , following the different treatments. Cold treatments (at both -4 and -20 °C) significantly enhance the production of all the DAMPs for all the formulations, compared to 37 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>). These data indicate that cold treatment alone can promote DAMP expression and induce ICD. Particularly, the formulation of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with cold treatments (i.e., ICIE) at -4 and -20 °C induces higher expression of HSP-70, HSP-90, HMGB1, and CRT than all the other formulations with the same cold treatment, indicating that cold-triggered release of both CPT and siR from the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs helps boost ICD beyond the cold treatment alone. When the frozen tumor cells undergo ICD, the released DAMPs promote recruitment, accumulation, as well as the maturation of DCs in the TME, which should enhance the engulfment of tumor antigens by DCs to facilitate antigen presentation to T cells. This eventually should result in the activation of CD8 + CTLs to kill tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , as schematically illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>.</p><p>The activation of an antitumor immune response requires the maturation of DCs and presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. To this end, the maturation of DCs with the capability of activating CD8 + T cells (that can recognize the OVA antigen) was evaluated by coculture of DCs and cancer cells (EO771-OVA) with various treatments. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, ICIE (CPT&amp;siR CRNPs+C) treatment at -20 °C elevates the maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs, CD11c + CD86 + ) to 49.4%. This level is significantly higher than that for the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (no cold treatment, by default), free CPT&amp;siR (no cold treatment, by default), and PBS (no cold treatment, by default). Antigen presentation capabilities in these mature BMDCs were examined by detecting the level of ovalbumin-derived peptide with the amino acid sequence of SIINFEKL that binds to the H-2Kb of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) molecule (to result in Kb-SIINFEKL) in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). BMDCs co-cultured with the EO771-OVA cells treated with ICIE express the highest amount of SIINFEKL (58.9%, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Indeed, this is significantly higher than that for BMDCs co-cultured with the EO771-OVA cells treated with CPT&amp;siR CRNPs, free CPT&amp;siR, and PBS (31.2, 17.0, and 3.1%, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). These data indicate the enhanced maturation of DCs with the capability of activating CD8+ T cells that can recognize the OVA antigen. Moreover, the co-culture of CD8 + T cells and BMDCs matured by the EO771-OVA cells that received the ICIE treatment secretes 2.3-, and 1.6-fold more pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) than the co-culture of CD8 + T cells and BMDCs matured by the EO771-OVA cells that received CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cold treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), suggesting the potentiation of antitumor immune response via increased DC maturation when combining cryosurgery with CPT&amp;siR CRNPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE enhances the proliferation, activation, and tumor-attacking efficacy of CD8 + T cells</head><p>When co-cultured with CD8 + T cells, BMDCs matured by EO771-OVA cells treated with ICIE at -20 °C substantially increase the proliferation of CD8 + T cells (78.9%, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>), which is significant compared to the treatments of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs, free CPT&amp;siR, and PBS (34.9, 16.4, and 8.3%, respectively). To investigate the activation of CD8 + T cells, we examined the expression of cytotoxic granzyme B (GZMB, a serine protease commonly found in the granules of CTLs) using flow cytometry. Indeed, ICIE increases the percentage of CD8 + GZMB + to 56.5%, which is significantly higher than that for CPT&amp;siR CRNPs, free CPT&amp;siR, and PBS (36.1, 26.4, and 17.0%, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>). done after the 8 h incubation.

The experiments for a-e were repeated three times independently with similar results. Data are presented as mean ± SD (g, i). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.</p><p>We next tested the tumor-attacking capability of the activated CD8 + T cells. CD8 + T cells activated by BMDCs that are matured by EO771-OVA cells receiving the ICIE treatment, migrate to and accumulate around the EO771-OVA tumor cells (labeled with green color) within 5 min to attack them persistently and the tumor cells are eventually dismantled within 4 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3k</ref>, Supplementary Movie 1). Furthermore, CD8 + T cells from the ICIE group result in a significantly higher percentage of cancer cell death (79.9%) than the cells from the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (30.0%) group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3l,</ref><ref type="figure">m</ref>). CD8 + T cells from the PBS and free CPT&amp;siR groups cause 16.1% and 17.7% of EO771-OVA cell death, respectively. To assess the synergistic effects of co-delivery of CPT and siR, we compared the cancer cell killing capability of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (either with or without cold treatment) with that CPT CRNPs alone, siR CRNPs alone, and the simple addition (i.e., additive effect) of the treatments with CPT CRNPs alone and siR CRNPs alone. In the absence of cold treatment, co-delivery of the two agents in the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs shows no synergistic effect (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>): it leads to ~31% of cancer cell death, which is less than the percentage of cancer cell death (~39%) due to the additive effect of the CPT CRNPs alone and siR CRNPs alone. Importantly, when cold treatment is applied, the synergistic effect of CPT and siR in CPT&amp;siR CRNPs is evident (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>): it causes a significantly higher p=1.3×10 <ref type="bibr">-6</ref> p=6.1×10 <ref type="bibr">-6</ref> p=5.5×10 <ref type="bibr">-5</ref> p=5.8×10 <ref type="bibr">-8</ref> p=6.5×10 <ref type="bibr">-6</ref> p=3.4×10 <ref type="bibr">-6</ref> p=1.1×10 <ref type="bibr">-7</ref> p=1.9×10 <ref type="bibr">-5</ref> p=1.6×10 <ref type="bibr">-6</ref> p=6.0×10 -7</p><p>Ãrticle <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36045-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36045-7</ref> </p><p>Nature Communications | (2023) 14:392 percentage of cancer cell death (80.5%) than that (61.4%) due to the additive anticancer effect of CPT CRNPs alone and siR CRNPs alone.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CRNPs accumulate in tumor and exhibit negligible hemolysis</head><p>To explore the in vivo distribution of CRNPs, an orthotopic mouse breast tumor model was created by injecting 1 × 10 6 EO771 cells per mouse into the left abdominal mammary fat pad of C57BL/6 mice to grow tumors (one per mouse) into approximately 100 mm 3 (at around 10 days). After intravenous injection of various formulations (CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs, free CPT&amp;Cy5-siR, and PBS) into the mice bearing EO771 tumors, Cy5 fluorescence in the mice was studied by whole animal imaging. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>, b, Cy5 fluorescence is evidently observable in the tumor areas (indicated by blue arrows) at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h only for the group of CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs. At each time point, blood was drawn from the mice for testing Cy5 fluorescence in circulation. Little Cy5 fluorescence signal is observable/detectable (decreased by one order of magnitude) after 8-12 h for the free CPT&amp;Cy5-siR group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>). In contrast, for the CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs group, the Cy5 fluorescence is evident even at  24 h, showing encapsulation of the Cy5-siR in the CRNPs can prolong its time in blood circulation because the nanoparticle can protect the siR from degradation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>). The fluorescence of Cy5 in different organs was further examined after sacrificing the mice at 24 h. Mice treated with free CPT&amp;Cy5-siR show minimal Cy5 fluorescence in tumors, but high Cy5 fluorescence in kidneys and liver and moderate-low fluorescence in the lung and spleen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). In contrast, the Cy5 fluorescence is significantly reduced in kidneys, and significantly increased in liver for the CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs group (which is not unusual for nanoparticles for drug delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> ), compared to the free CPT&amp;Cy5-siR group. Most importantly, the Cy5 fluorescence in tumors is significantly higher for the CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs group than the free CPT&amp;Cy5-siR group, indicating the tumor accumulating/targeting capability of the CRNPs. Although CPT&amp;Cy5-siR CRNPs show relatively higher accumulation in liver than free CPT&amp;Cy5-siR, drug release from the CRNPs in liver where no cryosurgery will be applied, would be minimal to minimize any potential toxicity of the two encapsulated agents before they are cleared out of the body via the liver. Since the CRNPs need to go through long blood circulation after intravenous (i.v.) injection, their blood biocompatibility was further examined with the hemolysis test. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4f</ref>, CPT&amp;siR CRNPs of 25-800 µg ml -1 (in PBS) induce a negligible percentage of hemolysis comparable to PBS while DW causes nearly complete hemolysis. Furthermore, compared to PBS, CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (800 µg ml -1 ) do not cause any morphological changes to the red blood cells (SEM images, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4f</ref>) after incubation with the whole blood at 37 °C for 24 h. These data show that no evident blood incompatibility is observable for the CRNPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE turns the TME from immunologically "cold" into "hot" in primary tumors</head><p>For these studies, C57BLC/6 mice were inoculated with EO771 cells (1 × 10 6 cells per gland) in the fat pad of both the left and right abdominal mammary glands, to create orthotopic breast tumors. After 10 days of tumor establishment, various formulations (PBS, free CPT&amp;siR, CPT CRNPs, siR CRNPs, and CPT&amp;siR CRNPs) were injected via the tail vein every three days for a total of nine injections either without (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>) or with (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>) cryosurgery. For the groups with cryosurgery, it was done on the left (in terms of mice) tumors once (blue arrow, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>) at 8 h after the first injection of the formulations by gently pressing the cryoprobe against the tumor at its central location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c</ref>). Therefore, the left tumors are called primary ones with cryosurgery while the right tumors without cryosurgery are called distant ones for all groups with cryosurgery. It is worth noting that the treatment with cryosurgery being conducted only once and the formulations being injected multiple times, is similar to how frequent cryosurgery (usually once) and chemotherapy (almost always multiple times) are conducted in the clinic. To monitor the temperature during the 10 min of cryosurgery, two K-type thermocouples (TCs) were used by gently pressing them on the surface of the primary tumor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c</ref>): one for measuring the temperature at the tumor boundary (TC1) and the other (TC2) for monitoring the temperature at the central location of the tumor next to the cryoprobe. During cryosurgery, the temperature at tumor boundary and central location was kept at approximately -4 and -20 °C for 10 min, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d</ref>). This was achieved by turning the cryoprobe on and off intermittently to maintain the iceball roughly within the tumor boundary during the cryosurgery procedure. Moreover, a FLIR infrared camera was used to monitor the temperature in the entire primary tumor area (indicated by dashed circles, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5e</ref>) during cryosurgery. Typical temperature contours in the tumor area together with the temperature on the tumor boundary at 0 s (before cryosurgery), 300 s (during cryosurgery), and 630 s (after cryosurgery and warming up) are also given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5e</ref>. Typical image showing frozen tumor iceball formation is also captured at 300 s during cryosurgery (for which the cryoprobe and TCs are temporarily removed).</p><p>After the aforementioned treatments, their impact on the TME in the primary tumors was studied. First, the PD-L1 silencing effect of siR in the primary (for mice with cryosurgery) and left (for mice without cryosurgery) tumors was determined by western blot. Both ICIE (i.e., CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with cryosurgery) and siR CRNPs with cryosurgery treatments significantly decrease the PD-L1 expression in tumors when compared with CPT CRNPs with cryosurgery or PBS with cryosurgery (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12a</ref>). In the absence of cryosurgery, the silencing effect is not evident for all the formulations including siR CRNPs or CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12b</ref>). Second, the expression of ICD markers (i.e., DAMPs including HMGB1, CRT, HSP-70, and HSP-90) is markedly increased in the primary tumors from the groups with cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5f</ref>), compared to their counterparts without cryosurgery (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">13</ref>). Notably, The ICIE treatment stimulates higher expression of all the ICD markers in the primary tumors than all the other treatments with or without cryosurgery. Third, compared to the percentage of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in left tumors (corresponding to primary tumors in mice with cryosurgery) of mice without cryosurgery, cryosurgery not only decreases the population of pro-tumorigenic M2 TAMs (F4/80 + CD206 + CD86 -) but also elevates the percentage of anti-tumorigenic M1 TAMs (F4/80 + CD206 -CD86 + ) in all treated groups (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14a-d</ref>). As a result, a marked increase in the M1/M2 ratios is observable in mice with cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5g</ref>), with the highest M1/M2 ratio of 4.0 ± 0.5 in mice receiving the ICIE treatment. Fourth, cryosurgery evidently attenuates the frequency of both monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs, CD11b + Ly6C + Ly6G -) and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs, CD11b + Ly6C -Ly6G + ) that perform their immunosuppressive activities within the TME (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5h</ref>, i and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15a-d</ref>). The ICIE treatment decreases the percentage of M-MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs to 8.8 ± 1.0% and 16.1 ± 2.1%, respectively, which is significantly lower than that for its counterpart (CPT&amp;siR CRNPs) with no cryosurgery (18.9 ± 1.4% for M-MDSCs and 35.4 ± 3.5% for PMN-MDSCs). Furthermore, in the primary tumor, the percentage of regulatory T (Treg, CD4 + Foxp3 + ) cells is greatly reduced by the ICIE treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). The PBS control group (without cryosurgery) had a high percentage of Treg (42.9 ± 3.0%), indicating an immunosuppressive TME <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> . The cryosurgery treatment can significantly reduce the percentage of Treg cells for all the formulations. Importantly, the ICIE treatment results in the most reduction of the Treg cell percentage to only 1.6 ± 0.7% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15e</ref>). Collectively, these data support that the ICIE treatment induces ICD; produces tumor antigens; and decreases the frequency of immunosuppressive M2, MDSCs, and Tregs; to reverse the immunologically cold TME. This is attributed to the cryosurgery-induced ICD reinforced by the cold-triggered rapid release of both the chemotherapy drug irinotecan (CPT) that inhibits DNA synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> , and the siRNA (siR) that silences the overexpression of T cell inhibitory ligand PD-L1 on cancer cells to remove the immune checkpoint that inhibits the activation of CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . In addition, the frostbite effect of cryosurgery might kill the M2, MDSCs, and Tregs in the immunosuppressive TME, to reduce their frequency in the tumor after cryosurgery. As a result, ICIE is highly effective to turn the immunologically cold TME into a hot one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE boosts the antitumor immune responses in primary tumors</head><p>To assess if the aforementioned modulation of TME by ICIE boosts the antitumor immune responses, we analyzed the population of DCs and CD8 + T cells in the mice. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, cryosurgery promotes maturation of DCs in the inguinal lymph nodes, leading to significantly increased percentages of mature DCs (CD11c + CD86 + ) for all the groups with cryosurgery. In particular, the ICIE treatment (i.e., CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with cryosurgery) triggers the highest percentage of DC maturation among all the treatments (with or without cryosurgery). Furthermore, in the primary tumors where the cryosurgery is applied, the augmented DC maturation enables significantly higher accumulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16c</ref>). Importantly, the percentage of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells for the ICIE group is the highest (23.8 ± 0.6% out of all T cells) among all groups, with a highest CD8 + / Treg ratio of 17.6 ± 10.3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6c</ref>) that is 117 times of the CD8 + /Treg ratio in the L tumor with the PBS treatment alone. This indicates the ICIE treatment turns the immunologically "cold" TME into a "hot" one. In contrast, the treatment of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery only results in 9.5 ± 0.8% of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16d</ref>) and a CD8 + /Treg ratio of 0.4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6c</ref>), indicating an immunologically "cold" TME. Similarly, the frequency of CD8 + GZMB + CTLs is the highest (27.6 ± 3.7% out of all CD8+ T cells) for the ICIE group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6d</ref> &amp; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), which is confirmed by immunofluorescence staining images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16g</ref>) showing the distribution of CD8 + GZMB + cells in tumor sections. It is worth noting that unlike hyperthermic therapy for which permanent vascular stasis occurs due to heating, there is a temporary (a few hours) reperfusion of the tumor immediately after thawing a frozen tumor iceball <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> , which may allow efficient immune cell infiltration into the tumor after cryosurgery to boost the antitumor responses. Collectively, these data support that the ICIE treatment may activate a strong antitumor immunity to kill cancer cells through a high level of GZMB secreted by CTLs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE generates both short-term and long-term memory immune effects</head><p>To explore whether the activation of immune responses in primary tumor generates memory immune effects, the amount of effector memory T (T EM , CD8 + CD44 + CD62L -) cells was measured first. The T EM cells circulate in the blood and are ready to exert direct and rapid cytotoxicity against any existing tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . Consistent with the improved antitumor immune responses in primary tumors, ICIE treatment significantly augments the proportion of T EM cells to 25.8 ± 1.3% from 3.9 ± 1.0% for PBS without cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">17a</ref>). Also, cryosurgery significantly increases the T EM cell proportion for all the formulations, compared to their counterparts without cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6g</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE boosts the antitumor immune responses in blood and distant tumors</head><p>As CD8 + T cells activated by the hot TME in primary tumor need to go with blood to enter distant tumors, we studied the CD8 + T cells together with Treg cells in blood first. The ratio of CD8 + to Treg cells (CD8 + / Treg), an important value that has been used to predict the antitumor immune response and treatment outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> , was therefore determined using whole blood samples. ICIE dramatically increases the CD8 + /Treg ratio to 90.7 ± 19.3 from 5.0 ± 0.8 for control treatment of PBS without cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6h</ref>, i and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">17e-g</ref>). Again, for all the formulations, cryosurgery significantly increases the CD8 + /Treg ratio in blood. Importantly, the ratio of CD8 + to Treg cells for the ICE treatment is higher than that for all the other treatments including CPT CRNPs, siR CRNPs, and free CPT&amp;siR either with or without cryosurgery. Notably, the subpopulation of Treg cells in blood is almost unidentifiable following the ICIE (i.e., CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with cryosurgery) treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6i</ref>), while the Treg subpopulation is evident for the treatment of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery (2.8 ± 0.5%, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">17g</ref>). These results suggest that the ICIE treatment in primary tumors is very promising in boosting the antitumor immune responses to distant tumors. Indeed, the ICIE treatment (i.e., CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with cryosurgery) on the primary tumors increases the CD8 + /Treg ratio to 8.1 ± 2.7 in distant (Dist) tumors (without freezing) in the same mice, which is 376.2-folds higher than that for the right-side (R) tumors of the PBS control from mice with no cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">18a-d</ref>). In contrast, a significantly lower CD8 + /Treg ratio (0.2) is observed in the distant tumors from mice treated with CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery. Although it is true that cryosurgery enhances CD8 + /Treg ratios for all the formulations studied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6j</ref>), the increase in the ratio is the most evident for the two formulations with siR. This suggests not only the cold-triggered drug/gene release but also the cold-triggered endo/lysosomal escape, in addition to the freezinginduced immune responses, is crucial to render the ICIE treatment with the potent antitumor immune responses against both primary and distant tumors. Moreover, ICIE elevates the percentage of CD8 + GZMB + T cells in distant tumors to 30.2 ± 2.8% (out of all CD8 + T cells, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6k</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">18e</ref>), which is 3.6-folds higher than that (8.3 ± 0.5%) for its non-cryosurgical counterpart (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">18f</ref>). Immunofluorescence staining of the distant tumors further confirms the aforementioned observations, showing more accumulation of CD8 GZMB + T cells in the ICIE than other groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6l</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">18g</ref>). Taken together, these data suggest that ICIE is promising for destroying not only primary but also distant tumors, which is further confirmed by tumor growth studies as detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE effectively inhibits the growth of both primary and distant tumors</head><p>To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the aforementioned antitumor immune responses, the dual orthotopic tumor model formed by injecting EO771 cells into both the left-side (L tumors for mice with no cryosurgery and primary tumors for mice with cryosurgery) and rightside (R tumors for mice with no cryosurgery and distant tumors for mice with cryosurgery done on the primary tumors) abdominal mammary fat pads of C57BL/6 mice as schematically illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>, b, was continuously observed for 37 days. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">19a-d</ref>, cryosurgery evidently decreases the growth of both primary and distant tumors from mice with cryosurgery on their primary tumors for all the formulations, compared to that of the L and R tumors from mice with no cryosurgery. In particular, the ICIE treatment (i.e., CPT&amp;siR CRNPs with cryosurgery) is the most effective in either inhibiting the tumor growth or inducing complete tumor eradication among all the treatments (with or without cryosurgery). In addition, in both the primary (left) and distant (right) tumors, the treatment of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs results in lower tumor volumes than other formulations (free CPT&amp;siR, CPT CRNPs and siR CRNPs) in the presence and absence of cryosurgery (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">19a-d</ref>). The therapeutic efficacy was further confirmed by tumor images and tumor weights obtained at the final day (day 37) of the in vivo study. Again, for all the formulations, cryosurgery evidently reduces tumor sizes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20a-c</ref>) and the reduction is significant for all the formulations according to the data of tumor weights (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). Also, either with or without cryosurgery, more inhibition of tumor growth and less tumor weight are observable for the formulation of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs than all the other formulations including free CPT&amp;siR, CPT CRNPs and siR CRNPs.</p><p>To further investigate the ICIE-induced tumor destruction, we sectioned the primary tumors from mice with cryosurgery and L tumor from mice with no cryosurgery and stained them for Ki-67 (representing tumor cell proliferation) and CD31 (representing angiogenesis). Similar to the tumor inhibition results, cryosurgery evidently downregulates the expression of both Ki-67 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">21a</ref>) and CD31 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">21b</ref>) in tumors treated with all the formulations, with the ICIE treatment results in the most reduction. This indicates the strongest inhibition of both tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization with the ICIE treatment. The antitumor effect was further investigated using hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) staining, which shows that necrosis is the most extensive in both and distant tumors from the ICIE group among all the other groups either with or without cryosurgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7e</ref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that no significant change of body weight was observed for mice treated with all formulations either with or without cryosurgery (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">22a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Also, H&amp;E staining analyses show no significant damages in the major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) harvested from mice sacrificed at the end of the in vivo study for all the treatments with therapeutic agents and/or cryosurgery, when compared to that of the PBS control group (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">23</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">24</ref>), suggesting the good biosafety of CRNPs. Furthermore, no significant changes in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels can be detected in the blood of mice after treatment with CPT CRNPs, siR CRNPs, or CPT&amp;siR CRNPs when compared to PBS group (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">25a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), confirming that the CRNPs cause negligible damage to the liver although they do have high accumulation in the liver after i.v. injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). Again, the minimal release of the encapsulated drugs from the CRNPs in the liver where no cryosurgery is performed, contributes to the negligible liver toxicity of the three different CRNPs. Collectively, these results indicate that ICIE generates an antitumor immune response to effectively kill both primary and distant tumors with no evident systemic toxicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICIE generates long-term antitumor memory immune response against metastatic tumors</head><p>To further evaluate the generation of long-term antitumor memory immune response by ICIE for preventing lung metastasis, Balb/c mice with 4T1 orthotopic tumors (OTs) were applied with different treatments including ICIE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8a</ref>). After priming for 10 days, a lung metastatic tumor model was formed by i.v. injection of 4T1 cancer cells (1 × 10 5 cells/mouse) and the mice were further injected with the various formulations till death or termination of experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8a</ref>). The results show that ICIE can not only significantly inhibit the growth of orthotopic 4T1 tumor and decrease the orthotopic tumor weight to 2.6-fold and 2.9-fold less than that of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor and PBS group with cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">26a</ref>), but also reduce the metastatic tumor burden in lungs, resulting in the lowest weight of lungs (0.21 ± 0.03 g, which is close to the weight of normal lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> ) amongst all treatment groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8b</ref>). As shown in the representative images of lungs collected at the end of the study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8c</ref>), ICIE greatly reduces the formation of metastatic foci in the lungs: the number of metastatic foci for the ICIE are 3.2-fold and 3.6fold less than that of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor and PBS group with cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8d</ref>). This is further confirmed by the H&amp;E staining data of lungs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8e</ref>), showing the least metastasis and most alveolar areas after ICIE treatment when compared to all other treatment groups. The strong inhibition of lung metastasis can be ascribed to the generation of the effector memory T (T EM , CD8 + CD44 + CD62L -) cells: ICIE significantly increases the effector memory T cells by 2.2 and 2.5 times compared with the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor and PBS group with cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">26b</ref>). As a result, the survival rate is significantly improved to 73% for mice with the ICIE treatment, while the survival rate of mice for the treatments of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs without cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor and PBS group with cryosurgery on orthotopic tumor is 50% and 47%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">27</ref>). These results support that ICIE can be applied to generate a durable long-term antitumor memory immune response to inhibit tumor metastasis and prolong overall animal survival. generates a robust antitumor and long-term antitumor memory immune response for eradicating both primary and distant as well as metastatic tumors in vivo with no evident systemic toxicity. The ICE strategy, which combines cryosurgery, cold-responsive nanomaterial, and immunotherapy, has the potential to transform the treatment of cancer and its metastasis for which conventional methods of cancer cryosurgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy alone or their dual combinations have fallen short.</p></div>

Briefly, for the polymerization of the ratio of 81:19 (NIPAAm:BA), 16.2 mmol (1.834 g) of NIPAAm, and 3.8 mmol (0.488 g) of BA were transferred into a flask and dissolved in 10 ml of dioxane. After purging the resultant solution with nitrogen gas for 30 min, 11.61 mg of AIBN dissolved in 5 ml of dioxane was added dropwise into the flask. The flask was then immersed into an oil-bath at 70 °C with the solution in it being stirred at 400 rpm for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymerization was stopped by exposing the flask to air for cooling down to room temperature (~22 °C). Afterwards, the resultant sample was precipitated in excessive amount of cold diethyl ether and filtered through a filter paper (size: 9.0 cm, VWR, Radnor, PA, USA). After dissolving in tetrahydrofuran and precipitating in cold diethyl ether for three times, the synthesized polymers were dried overnight under vacuum. The same procedure was used for the polymerization of NIPAAm and BA at the 80:20, 82:18, and 83:17 ratios, aside from the differences in the NIPAAm:BA molar ratios to give a total amount of 20 mmol for both monomers.</p><p>To confirm successful synthesis of the pNIPAAm-BA polymers, 10 mg of each polymer was dissolved in deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3 ) and analyzed by 1 H-NMR with an Ultrashield Plus 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiments were performed with a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) GPC instrument equipped with a 2414 refractive index (RI) detector and Styragel columns (HR4: 5 µm, 7.8 × 300 mm and HR5: 5 µm, 7.8×300 mm) in the presence of tetrahydrofuran as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min -1 at 35 °C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of LCST</head><p>To determine the LCST of the pNIPAAm-BA polymers, microscopic images of the aqueous samples of the polymers during cooling on a Linkam (Waterfield, UK) temperature-controlled microscope stage were taken. Briefly, a polymer film was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of polymer in 1 ml of ethanol and adding to the Linkam quartz crucible sample holder (Waterfield, UK) for drying. Then 500 µl of deionized water (DW) was added into the crucible of the Linkam temperaturecontrolled microscope stage mounted on a Zeiss Axio Scope A1 microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). After loading the holder with the sample into the stage, the stage was held at 10 °C for 5 min for temperature equilibration in the sample. Then, the sample was cooled from 10 to -15 °C at a cooling rate of 0.5 °C min -1 , during which the sample images were taken every 20 s. Grayscale values of the images were quantified using the Image Processing Toolbox in MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, United States). Grayscale values of all images were normalized to that of the first image at 10 °C and plotted against the recorded temperature during cooling. The change in grayscale value indicates a change in transparency in the sample. The LCST was determined as the temperature at the point where the second derivative of the data (i.e., the image grayscale value versus temperature) was equal to zero, or the inflection point in the curve of the image grayscale value versus temperature. The data were plotted with Origin 8.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis of nanoparticles</head><p>CPT&amp;siR CRNPs were prepared by a double-emulsion (water-in-oil-inwater or W-O-W) method. Briefly, to prepare the first water phase, 1 mg ml -1 aqueous chitosan solution was made by dissolving chitosan in 25 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0). A total of 200 µl of chitosan solution was added into 100 µl of aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) solution (20 mg ml -1 ) and mixed. During mixing, 50 µl of siRNA (100 µM) was added dropwise into the mixture and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For the oil phase, 15 mg of PLGA, 30 mg of pNIPAAm-BA, 10 mg of PF-127, 5 mg of DPPC, and 2.5 mg of CPT were dissolved in 2 ml of dichloromethane (DCM). To form the first W-O emulsion, the first water phase containing the siRNA was added dropwise into the oil phase and emulsified at an amplitude of 10% for 1 min using a Branson 450 sonifier (Hampton, NH, USA). The first emulsion was then added into 5 ml of the second water phase, which was 2% PVA solution containing 10 mg of CS-PF127. The resultant sample was further emulsified by sonication (10% amplitude) for another 1 min to form the W-O-W emulsion, which was stirred overnight at 1200 rpm using a stir bar. Right after sonication, 5 ml of 2% PVA solution was added into the second emulsion. The sample was centrifuged (13800 g) at room temperature for 20 min to collect the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs, which were washed with DW once and redispersed in DW. The procedures for making the CPT CRNPs, siR CRNPs, and CPT&amp;siR PLGA nanoparticles were the same as that for making the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs except that siR, CPT, and pNIPAAm-BA were not used, respectively. For the preparation of CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (no NaCl), the procedure was the same with that for preparing the CPT&amp;siR CRNPs except that NaCl was not used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of nanoparticles</head><p>To determine the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) of CPT, the pellets of the nanoparticles were dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance of CPT was measured by a Tecan (Männedorf, Switzerland) Spark Multimode Microplate Reader at 375 nm and the amount of drug was quantified by a calibration curve made with various known concentrations of CPT. EE and LC were calculated as: EE = (CPT in the pellet)/(CPT fed for synthesis) × 100%, LC = (CPT in the pellet)/(Total weight of the pellet) × 100%. For quantifying the amount of siR in the nanoparticles, siR was isolated by dissolving the pellets with chloroform and extracting the siR with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (TE) buffer.

On day 10, mice with EO771 tumors on both sides were randomly divided into ten groups (five groups without cryosurgery/cryo and five groups with cryosurgery done on the primary tumors on the left side of the mice) and intravenously administered with PBS (no cryosurgery/Cryo), free CPT&amp;siR (no Cryo), CPT CRNPs (no Cryo), siR CRNPs (no Cryo), and CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (no cryo); and PBS (Cryo), free CPT&amp;siR (Cryo), CPT CRNPs (Cryo), siR CRNPs (Cryo), CPT&amp;siR CRNPs (Cryo). The number (n) of mice for each group is 9 with 6 mice for monitoring the tumor growth and 3 mice for analyzing the immune cells and cytokines on day 20. The doses of CPT and Cy5-siR were 2.0 mg kg -1 and 30 µg kg -1 , respectively. Cryosurgery was done on the left tumors at 8 h after the first injection of the various formulations. The injections were continued every 3 days until the end of the study. Body weight and tumor size were recorded every 3 days, and tumor volume was calculated as follows: V = 0.5 × L × W 2 , where V, L, and W are the tumor volume, long diameter, and short diameter, respectively. The maximal tumor size/ burden permitted by the IACUC at the University of Maryland, College Park, is 1.5 cm in long/short diameter. During the whole experiment, the maximal tumor size/burden was not exceeded. For cryosurgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane first. Cryosurgery was then performed by touching the skin of the tumor area with a cryoprobe (Dahai Mechanical &amp; Electronic Equipment Manufactory, Jiangsu, China) at its central location of the tumor area and freezing for a total of 10 min. The cryoprobe was connected to a DH-286 Cryogenic Therapeutic Apparatus (Dahai Mechanical &amp;Electronic Equipment Manufactory).

All flow cytometry data was analyzed with FlowJo (v10, BD). Moreover, after cryosection, the presence of CD8 + GZMB + cells and the generation of HMGB1, CRT, HSP-70, and HSP-90 in tumor tissues were investigated by immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, cryosectioned tumor slides were washed with PBS for 3 times, fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, and rinsed with PBS for 3 times.
