<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nucleic acid therapeutics are used for silencing, expressing or editing genes in vivo. However, their systemic stability and targeted delivery to bone marrow resident cells remains a challenge. In this study we present a nanotechnology platform based on natural lipoproteins, designed for delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides and messenger RNA to myeloid cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow. We developed a prototype apolipoprotein nanoparticle (aNP) that stably incorporates siRNA into its core. We then created a comprehensive library of aNP formulations and extensively characterized their physicochemical properties and in vitro performance. From this library, we selected eight representative aNP-siRNA formulations and evaluated their ability to silence lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) expression in immune cell subsets in mice after intravenous administration. Using the most effective aNP identified from the screening process, we tested the platform's potential for therapeutic gene silencing in a syngeneic murine tumour model. We also demonstrated the aNP platform's suitability for splice-switching with antisense oligonucleotides and for protein production with messenger RNA by myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Our data indicate that the aNP platform holds translational potential for delivering various types of nucleic acid therapeutics to myeloid cells and their progenitors.</p><p>Genetic drugs' real-life potential is critically dependent on delivery technologies that prevent the nucleic acid payload's premature degradation while actively delivering it to the cells of interest 1 . In past decades, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology emerged that enabled the first small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic's clinical translation, involving gene silencing in hepatocytes to treat hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis 2,3 . Furthermore, LNP technology was essential for the COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines 4,5 , and facilitates in vivo gene editing approaches currently undergoing clinical evaluation 6,7 . To enable targeting of tissues and cells beyond the liver 8 , several LNP modification and screening strategies have been developed and evaluated preclinically. These include incorporating charged phospholipids 9,10 , antibody surface modification of LNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and DNA barcoding strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . However, platform technologies that possess biocompatible and tunable biodistribution features must be developed to unlock RNA therapeutics' full potential for systemic delivery.</p><p>Here we introduce a nanodelivery strategy based on lipoprotein trafficking, designed for extrahepatic delivery to immune cells. Lipoproteins are endogenous, nanosized transport systems composed of apolipoproteins and aggregates of fatty molecules 20 . They inherently interact with various cells and exhibit compelling features for RNA</p></div>

In addition to unformulated 89   Zr-labelled siRNA ( 89 Zr-siRNA), we intravenously administered LNP-89 Zr-siRNA and aNP- <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">89</ref> Zr-siRNA to mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1l,</ref><ref type="figure">m</ref>). After 24 h, PET imaging uncovered unformulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">89</ref> Zr-siRNA to be renally cleared (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1l</ref>), whereas aNP-formulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">89</ref> Zr-siRNA accumulated much stronger in the spleen and bone marrow as compared with LNP delivery. Quantitative ex vivo gamma counting corroborated these in vivo PET imaging findings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1m</ref>).</p><p>We next evaluated the prototype aNP's silencing potential in leukocytes. To achieve this, we first ex vivo-screened eight siRNA constructs targeting Lamp1 mRNA (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). LAMP1 is expressed on the cell surface and can be quantified by flow cytometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . We formulated the most potent anti-LAMP1 siRNA (siLAMP1) into the prototype aNP formulation and administered four intravenous aNP-siLAMP1 doses (0.5 mg kg -1 siLAMP1, injected 36 h apart) to mice. Aside from the liver's Kupffer cells and endothelial cells, we observed significant LAMP1 knockdown in leukocytes in the spleen (P &lt; 0.0001) and bone marrow (P = 0.0004) as compared with an aNP containing scrambled siRNA (siCtrl), which is mainly attributed to LAMP1 silencing in myeloid cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1n</ref>). The in vivo aNP-siLAMP1 silencing potency was on par with an LNP-siLAMP1 formulation used as a positive control (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>aNP library screening</head><p>After prototyping the aNP-siRNA concept, we designed an aNP optimization strategy involving an iterative design process that resulted in a library of 72 compositionally distinct aNP-siRNA formulations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Within the library, we kept siRNA and apoA1 levels constant while varying the amount of cholesterol, tricaprylin and the MC3 ionizable cationic lipid (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). MC3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> complexes negatively charged siRNA to enable its integration into an aNP's lipophilic core, whereas cholesterol and tricaprylin provide structural features that are essential for an aNP's supramolecular organization and structural stability. Amphiphilic phospholipids are required to disperse the lipophilic supramolecular nanoaggregates of siRNA, MC3, tricaprylin and cholesterol in an aqueous environment and, together with apoA1, stabilize the aNP. We selected three phospholipids that are known to properly interact with apoA1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , namely, DMPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). After formulating over two dozen DPPC-based aNPs, we did not identify stable formulations with adequate in vitro silencing features (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and decided to exclude these formulations from the library and further testing.</p><p>The different aNP compositions and quality features are schematically depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>. We observed that increased tricaprylin improved DMPC-based formulations, but not aNPs containing POPC. Cryo-EM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) revealed that tricaprylin inclusion promoted the delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . The widely studied apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is high-density lipoprotein's (HDL) main protein constituent <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Capitalizing on apoA1's natural function, we developed platform nanotechnology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> to deliver RNA to myeloid cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). After establishing a prototype apolipoprotein nanoparticle (aNP) that stably incorporates siRNA in its core, we established a comprehensive aNP-siRNA library and characterized the in vitro properties of individual formulations. We subsequently selected eight aNP-siRNA formulations that are representative of the library's diversity, and in vivo screened their capacity to silence lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) expression in diverse immune cell subsets in mice. We also studied a lead aNP-siRNA candidate's physicochemical properties, tissue biodistribution and its potential for therapeutic gene silencing in a syngeneic murine tumour model. Finally, we demonstrate the aNP platform's suitability for splice-switching with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and for in vivo protein production with mRNA by myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prototyping aNPs for siRNA delivery</head><p>First, we developed a two-step flow manufacturing process for an aNP prototype containing siRNA using a T-junction mixer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The prototype aNP components depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> include 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), cholesterol, tricaprylin, a triglyceride that makes up the core matrix accomodating siRNA complexed with the ionizable lipid (6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z)-heptatriacont-6,9,28,31-tetraene-19-yl-4-(dimethylamino)butanoate (MC3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , and apoA1. Importantly, we found siRNA recovery, entrapment and retention to be higher than 80% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), which is indicative of efficient siRNA incorporation. The prototype aNPs contained consistent quantities of apoA1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>), and had a mean hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 80 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>), with a size dispersity of 0.1, as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). We qualitatively corroborated both size and size distribution by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>), which revealed spherical core-shell structures. Using a gold nanoparticle antibody-labelling method, we visualized apoA1's integration in the aNP by negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</p><p>In an in vitro silencing assay using RAW 264.7 murine macrophages that stably express firefly-and Renilla luciferase, we determined an IC 50 value of 14.5 nM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>), which was considerably better than 154.3 nM for a clinically approved MC3-based LNP control formulation (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We then developed a unique siRNA radiolabelling strategy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) to quantitatively measure siRNA biodistribution by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo gamma counting. Using azide-alkyne click chemistry, we functionalized siRNA with desferrioxamine B (DFO) to enable radiolabelling with zirconium-89 ( 89 Zr; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).

In the absence of tricaprylin (aNP 1-24 ), cryo-EM revealed an array of different morphologies, ranging from spherical (for example, aNP 4,7,10,11 ), to multilamellar (for example, aNP 3,6,15 ), to elliptical (for example, aNP 30 ); there were also less well defined shapes such as aNP 18 and aNP 21 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).   <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-024-01847-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-024-01847-3</ref> </p><p>As a critical quality feature, we measured aNP aggregation directly after production by semi-quantitative assessment of cryo-EM images (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). We found 55 formulations to pass our predefined threshold of &lt;15%. Using DLS, we also determined the size dispersity and stability of the aNPs when stored at 4 °C for up to 28 days. Interestingly, we observed little correlation between initial aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>) and shelf-life stability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>). Finally, we measured the gene silencing capacity of all 72 aNP formulations in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref>). We observed diverse gene knockdown capabilities at a fixed concentration of 100 nM siRNA, ranging from no silencing to nearly complete gene silencing.

From those 30 formulations, we selected eight functional aNPs representative of the library's diversity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>, in bold) to be included in the ensuing in vivo gene silencing experiments in mice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functionally screening aNPs in vivo</head><p>Following aNP library characterization and in vitro screening, we selected eight representative aNPs for in vivo testing in mice, including the aNP prototype (aNP 72 ). Similar to the experiments we conducted with the aNP prototype, we encapsulated siLAMP1 in the selected aNPs. We first assessed the knockdown functionality of these eight aNP-siLAMP1 formulations using bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from mice ex vivo. At 100 nM siLAMP1, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) measurements disclosed that all eight aNPs substantially reduced LAMP1 expression compared with the untreated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>). After establishing their functionality, we intravenously administered the eight different aNP-siLAMP1 formulations to mice four times at 36 h intervals, with a siLAMP1 dose of 0.5 mg kg -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>). Following this aNP-siLAMP1 treatment regimen, we sacrificed the mice and collected bone marrow cells. These cells were stained with flow cytometry antibody panels that we optimized for the detection of haematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitors and mature myeloid cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Within the aNP selection, we found substantial variability in LAMP1 silencing features in immune cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>,f and Extended Data Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref>). Although a clinically approved MC3-based LNP formulation did not induce significant (P &gt; 0.9999) LAMP1 knockdown in HSPCs, we observed significant LAMP1 silencing when using aNP 8 (P = 0.0107), aNP 18 (P = 0.0117) and aNP 67 (P = 0.0306). Although aNP 8 (P = 0.0084) and aNP 18 (P = 0.0038) also significantly silenced LAMP1 in myeloid progenitor cells, we did not observe significant LAMP1 knockdown in this progenitor subset using aNP 67 (P = 0.5506). Refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3g</ref> for a comprehensive overview of the in vivo silencing features of the different aNP-siLAMP1 formulations. On the basis of these data, aNP 8 and aNP 18 formulations showed potential for broad gene silencing of stem and progenitor populations. At the same time, aNP 67 displays a silencing bias towards stem cells. In light of aNP 18 's broad silencing features, we selected this formulation for further studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>aNP-siRNA profiling and application</head><p>After identifying broad gene silencing features (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), we selected aNP 18 for in-depth analysis. aNP 18 is a DMPC-based formulation that does not contain tricaprylin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>). It demonstrates siRNA recovery, entrapment and retention values of over 80% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>) while maintaining consistent apoA1 levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>) across multiple batches. aNP 18 has a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 50 nm, with a narrow size distribution (PDI &lt; 0.2; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>), and zeta potential of -20 mV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4e</ref>).</p><p>Notable, its siRNA entrapment, hydrodynamic diameter and dispersity remained stable for eight weeks when stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>). Furthermore, cryo-EM data revealed that aNP 18 -siRNA predominantly consists of multilamellar, elliptical structures, which was consistent across six independently produced batches (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4f</ref>).</p><p>Using the same method that we applied for the prototype aNP 72 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>), we integrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">89</ref> Zr-siRNA into aNP 18 to assess its biodistribution in mice at various time points following intravenous administration using ex vivo gamma counting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4g</ref>). For aNP 18 , we observed considerable bone marrow accumulation and approximately twofold-higher uptake in the spleen compared with LNPs after 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1m</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>). As the spleen also contains myeloid and progenitor cells, the high uptake in this organ is beneficial. The liver uptake-which we found to be slightly lower than for LNPs 24 h after administration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1m</ref>)-and kidney accumulation must be considered and carefully monitored. We therefore measured liver enzymes and kidney toxicity markers, and did not observe substantial differences after PBS or aNP 18 -siRNA injections (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>). Furthermore, a single aNP 18 -siRNA administration resulted in tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations comparable with mice that received intravenous PBS, and significantly lower concentrations (P = 0.0432 for TNFα and P &lt; 0.0001 for IL-6) than mice receiving intraperitoneal LPS, used as positive control (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>).</p><p>We next evaluated aNP 18 's therapeutic potential by silencing C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (Ccr2) expression in a syngeneic tumour mouse model. LNP-siRNA targeting Ccr2 mRNA (siCCR2) treatment has previously been shown to decrease influx of myeloid cells in tumours, affecting the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4h</ref>). We therefore formulated aNP 18 with two siCCR2 constructs that induced CCR2 knockdown in murine BMDMs ex vivo compared with aNP-siCtrl (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). Finally, using the most potent siCCR2 construct, we administered aNP 18 -siCCR2 intravenously to MC38 tumour-bearing C57/BL6 mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4i</ref>). Treatment with aNP 18 -siCCR2 induced significant CCR2 knockdown in ly6C lo monocytes of the bone marrow (P = 0.005), spleen (P = 0.0056) and blood (P = 0.0007) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4j-l</ref>). Simultaneously, and in line with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , we observed a considerable decrease of tumour-resident CCR2 + myeloid cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and macrophages following aNP 18 -siCCR2 treatment compared with aNP 18 -siCtrl (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4m</ref>,n), without impacting tumour size (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8d</ref>). As these myeloid cells are generally immunosuppressive <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , their reduced presence indicates a decreased influx of monocytes from the haematopoietic organs, indicative of the aNP platform's potential for immunotherapy. Furthermore, we did not observe notable changes in body weight (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8e</ref>), liver enzyme levels, kidney toxicity markers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4o</ref>), or damage using histological analyses of liver i, Schematic treatment regimen involving MC38-tumour-bearing mice (n = 5 mice per group) receiving repeated intravenous administrations of aNP 18 containing scrambled siRNA (aNP 18 -siCtrl) or CCR2 siRNA (aNP 18 -siCCR2) (0.5 mg kg -1 per administration, cumulative dose of 3.5 mg kg -1 ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>aNPs functionally deliver ASO and mRNA</head><p>Aside from gene silencing, we explored the aNP platform's capacity for delivering other types of nucleic acid therapeutics. Using the approach we established for the prototype aNP 72 -siRNA, we first conducted pilot experiments to identify stable aNP formulations containing the ionizable cationic lipid ALC-0315 (refs. 4,35). Using a tailored formulation containing POPC, cholesterol and ALC-0315, we incorporated an ASO that induces splice-switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> at an N/P ratio of 9 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>). The aNP-ASO formulation's mean hydrodynamic diameter was approximately 120 nm with a narrow size distribution (PDI &lt; 0.1; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10b</ref>). Cryo-EM corroborated this finding and uncovered coreshell structures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>). In line with aNP-siRNA formulations, ASO was stably incorporated, with entrapment and recovery values of around 80% (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10c</ref>). To determine the aNP-ASO's functional splice-switching effects in vitro, we transfected RAW 264.7 cells with the NATURA reporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . These cells stably express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), which changes to turbo red fluorescent protein expression (tRFP) upon successful blocking of a frameshift exon by a specific ASO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a</ref>). Following the reporter cells' exposure to aNPs containing frameshift-targeted ASO, we observed dose-dependent splice-switching effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d</ref>). We observed no splice-switching for the control aNP.</p><p>To evaluate the aNP platform's ability to encapsulate and deliver mRNAs, we designed an aNP containing DMPC, cholesterol, triglycerides and ALC-0315 using an N/P ratio of 6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e</ref>). Cryo-EM revealed aNP-mRNA had a spherical morphology and a diameter of about 70 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5f</ref>), which was confirmed by DLS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5g</ref>). We also found mRNA entrapment to be efficient (&gt;80%) and constant between various aNP-mRNA batches (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5h</ref>). Importantly, the aNP formulation's mRNA entrapment, hydrodynamic diameter and dispersity remained stable for eight weeks when stored in PBS at 4 °C (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>). The aNP-mRNA's zeta potential of approximately -17 mV was comparable with aNP 18 -siRNA (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5iand 4e</ref>). To evaluate mRNA translation in vitro, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-024-01847-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-024-01847-3</ref> </p><p>we treated RAW 264.7 cells with aNPs containing mRNA-encoding GFP. Flow cytometry analysis revealed efficient and dose-dependent transfection efficiency (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). Finally, we evaluated aNP-mRNA's functional effects in vivo by intravenously administering aNPs and LNPs containing mRNA-encoding mCherry. Flow cytometry analyses of bone marrow myeloid progenitors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5j</ref>,k) revealed significantly more mCherry + cells (P = 0.0241) and higher expression levels (P = 0.0407) following treatment with aNP-mRNA when compared to LNP-mRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5l</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Lipid molecules such as cholesterol are transported throughout the body via endogenous nanoparticles known as lipoproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . For example, HDL can accept cholesterol from myeloid cells such as macrophages in inflammatory tissues-a process mediated by passive diffusion and via ATP-binding cassette transporters and scavenger receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Aside from interacting with mature myeloid cells, HDL has been shown to directly interact with HSPCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . Although lipoproteins fulfill many important tasks in lipid metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , HDL has also been implicated in transporting RNAs in the human body <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Owing to these diverse features, HDL and its trafficking in the human body provide a compelling framework for RNA delivery to immune cells and their progenitors in the bone marrow. Although reconstituted HDL or HDL-mimicking nanoparticles have been developed for delivering cholesterol-conjugated siRNA, this strategy results in hydrophilic siRNA's surface-integration through the lipophilic cholesterol anchor that is incorporated in the phospholipid layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . This approach has been explored for hepatic delivery via scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and vaccine purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . Others have used apolipoproteins containing cationic lipoplexes for RNA delivery, inevitably exposing the payload to the outside environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . Here we presented the development and evaluation of the aNP platform that stably incorporates a variety of nucleic acid payloads in its core. By varying the aNP composition (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), we can finetune properties to optimize RNA delivery to diverse myeloid cells, as well as HSPCs in the bone marrow. Although LNPs have been shown to reach bone marrow endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> , compositional modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> or antibody conjugation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> are generally required for efficient HSPC targeting. Importantly, it should be considered that LNP technology was not explicitly designed for immune cell targeting. Conversely, we specifically designed the aNP platform with immune cell and HSPC targeting in mind and achieved gene regulation in these cell subsets. On the basis of our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , we assume aNP interactions with myeloid cells and their bone marrow progenitors are primarily mediated via apoA1. However, we cannot exclude aNPs containing a small fraction of other apolipoproteins due to the apoA1 isolation protocol we have used for this study. Besides gene silencing using siRNA, aNPs are suitable for delivering functional ASOs and mRNA. We foresee aNP delivery technology progressing into a designer platform for therapeutic immunoregulation in a wide range of immune-mediated diseases, for diverse vaccination applications, and for gene HSPC editing in certain hereditary diseases. The aNP platform's natural features ensure high biocompatibility and allow for repeated dosing, which, in conjunction with its modularity and the ability to scale production, make it attractive for clinical translation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>aNP production</head><p>Apolipoprotein nanoparticles containing nucleic acids were formulated by rapid T-junction mixing as previously described in ref. 28. The lipid molecules (POPC; DMPC or DSPC; cholesterol; tricaprylin (PEG-DMG for LNP particles); and DLin-MC3-DMA) were dissolved in ethanol at ratios specified in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. siRNA, mRNA or ASO were dissolved in 25 mM sodium acetate (pH 4). Next, organic and aqueous phases were mixed through a T-junction at a flow rate ratio of 1:3 (organic-to-aqueous) and collected in a 12-14 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por). Nanoparticle formulations were dialysed against 1× PBS (pH 7.4) for 4 h and refreshed for dialysis overnight at 4 °C while stirred at 150 r.p.m. Excess organic and aqueous phases were stored at 4 °C for physicochemical analysis. On the next day, samples were collected from the dialysis bags and the volume was determined. For the aNP particles, the appropriate amount of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) in PBS was diluted to one-third of the nanoparticle sample volume. ApoA1 was introduced to the nanoparticle formulations by rapid T-junction mixing at a flow rate ratio of 1:3 (apoA1 solution/nanoparticle solution). After apoA1 addition, samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h for aNP-siRNA and aNP-ASO, and 20 min for aNP-mRNA. The resulting product was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter, and concentrated and purified by centrifugal filtration using a 100 kDa MWCO filter. Samples were diluted to the desired siRNA, ASO or mRNA concentration and stored at 4 °C until further use. Aseptic techniques were used after 0.2 µm filtration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>aNP physicochemical analysis</head><p>The nanoparticle hydrodynamic diameter (expressed as the number-weighted mean diameter) and zeta potential were determined by DLS using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a Zetasizer NanoSampler (Malvern Instruments). Size dispersity was measured as the PDI. For DLS measurements, 100 µl of the formulation sample was diluted into 700 µl of 1× PBS and equilibrated at room temperature before analysis. Each sample was measured five times (10 runs of 10 s) without fixing the attenuator and measurement position. For zeta potential measurements, the sample was diluted 50 times in MilliQ water, and 700 µl of diluted sample was loaded in a disposable folded capillary cuvette (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical). Five measurements were performed at intervals of 300 s, and each measurement comprised 40 runs with 40 V applied. The Quant-iT RiboGreen assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to quantify the amount of RNA loaded inside of the formulated particles. A standard formulation sample with a theoretical RNA concentration of 133.3 µg ml -1 , was diluted 200 times in TE buffer both with and without 2% Triton X-100 in a black 96-well plate to a total volume of 100 µl. The Triton detergent disrupts the lipid-based nanoparticles; therefore, total RNA (retained and unretained) becomes accessible for the Quant-iT RiboGreen reagent. Known RNA controls, stored during formulation, were diluted 53.3 times in TE buffer both with and without 2% Triton to a total volume of 100 µl. Next, RiboGreen reagent was 200-fold diluted using TE buffer both with and without Triton X-100; 100 µl of this dilution was added to each well containing sample or control to bring the total volume to 200 µl. The fluorescence of the samples was then measured on a Tecan Spark microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. RNA recovery was determined as: (amount of RNA (retained + unretained))/(total amount of RNA (used in the formulation)) × 100%. The entrapment of RNA was defined as: (1-((amount of RNA (retained + unretained))/(total amount of RNA (used in the formulation)))) × 100%. RNA retention was determined as: recovery × entrapment. Cholesterol was quantified using the cholesterol FS assays (DiaSYS). Briefly, 240 µl of buffer containing colour reagent was added to 10 µl of sample in a transparent 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Absorbance was measured at 500 nm using a Tecan Spark plate reader. Phospholipids were quantified using the LabAssay Phospholipid (FUJIFILM). For this assay, 190 µl of buffer containing colour reagent is added to 10 µl of the sample in a transparent 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm using a Tecan Spark plate reader. The amount of apoA1 was quantified using the Apolipoprotein A1 FS assay (DiaSYS). In short, 200 µl of Reagent 1 was added to 5 µl sample or control in a transparent 96-well plate. After incubating the plate at 37 °C for 5 min, the absorbance was measured using a Tecan Spark microplate reader at 580 nm. Next, 50 µl of Reagent 2 containing an anti-apoA1 antibody was added and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before measuring the absorbance at the same setting.</p></div>

Using KBr salt, the density was adjusted to 1.22-1.24 g ml <ref type="bibr">-1</ref> , and the solution was centrifuged for 48 h, 250,000 × g at 4 °C. The gel-like pellets were carefully collected and dissolved overnight in Milli-Q on a roller at 400 r.p.m. and 4 °C to a concentration of 37.5 mg ml -1 . Next, the HDL solution was dripped at a 0.4 ml min -1 into methanol/chloroform (50/50 vol%) on dry ice to separate the lipids from the protein. About 50 mg of HDL precipitated in 240 ml solvent. The solvent containing the protein precipitate was decanted and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully discarded, and the whitish apoA1 pellets collected. The pellets were dried in the vacuum oven at 37 °C for 2-3 h to remove residual solvent. The resulting white-yellowish flakes were redissolved in 6 M guanidine solution (5 ml per 50 mg of protein). Finally, isolated protein was dialysed against PBS at 4 °C for one week. Phosphate-buffered saline was refreshed daily (dialysis ratio = 1:100) and 3,500 Da MWCO SnakeSkin dialysis membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The dialysate was collected and quality was assessed via SDS-page, Nanodrop and Apolipoprotein FS assay. ApoA1 was aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C.</p></div>

After overnight recovery, the cells were transfected with nanoparticles containing either scrambled siRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT) or anti-firefly luciferase siRNA at the desired concentration. After incubating for 48 h, the medium was washed off with 1× PBS and lysate phosphate buffer (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) was added to lyse the cells; 10 µl of the cell lysate was transferred to a white 96-well flat-bottomed plate. Subsequently, 40 µl of ONE-Glo reagent (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) was added and luminescence was measured with a Tecan Spark microplate reader at an integration time of 500 ms and settle time of 1,000 ms. A luminescence scan was performed to validate the intensity peak at 560 nm for firefly luciferase; 40 µl of Stop and Glo reagent (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) was then added to each well and the luminescence was measured again in the same way. The firefly luminescence was normalized to the Renilla luminescence and subsequently expressed as a percentage of the untreated sample signal.</p></div>

In short, RAW 264.7_PC2 cells (ATCC TIB-71) were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 30,000 cells per well. Cells were left to attach overnight. Next, the cells were transfected with aNPs containing either target or scrambled ASOs at concentrations ranging from 12.5-200 nM ASO; 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, washed, stained with DRAQ7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended in FACS buffer (1x PBS + 0.5% BSA + 2 mM EDTA). All data were acquired using the BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD biosciences), eGFP (FITC), tRFP (PE) and DRAQ7 (APC). As a positive control, RAW 264.7_PCT cells that continuously express tRFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> were utilized.

Subsequently, 3 µl of aNP sample was applied on a grid and vitrified into a thin film by plunge vitrification in liquid ethane using an automated robot (FEI Vitrobot Mark IV). Cryo-EM imaging was performed on the cryoTITAN (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a field emission gun, a post column Gatan imaging filter (model 2002), and a post-GIF 2k × 2k Gatan CCD camera (model 794). The micrographs were acquired at either 6,500× (electron dose of 1.64 electrons Å -2 s -1 ) or 24,000× magnification (electron dose of 11.8 Å -2 s -1 ) at 300 kV acceleration voltage in the bright-field TEM mode with zero-loss energy filtering and a 1 s acquisition time.

The grid was washed five times by incubating it on a 20 µl droplet of PBS for 2 min each time. Next, it was placed on 20 µl of 1% BSA in PBS for 3 min and then on 20 µl of mouse anti-human monoclonal apoA1 antibody in 1% BSA (dilution 1:200, clone: B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min.

Finally, the grids were washed six times in PBS and ten times in demi water (each wash was 20 µl and a 3 min incubation). The grid was then placed on a 20 µl droplet of 2% uranyl acetate in water for 5 min. After these steps, the TEM grids were air-dried overnight.

The cell pellets from the whole blood, spleen and bone marrow were resuspended in 1× red blood cell lysis (catalogue no. 420302, Biolegend). The samples were then incubated for 3 × 7 min on ice (blood), or at room temperature for 4 min (spleen) or 1 min (bone marrow). Quenching was achieved with flow buffer and cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Next, the single cells were transferred to a Corning V-bottom 96-well plate and incubated with 50 µl viakrome 808 (catalogue no. C36628, Beckman Coulter) diluted in PBS for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. The cells were then washed, centrifuged again and incubated with CD16/32 (Fc-block, 101302, BioLegend) antibodies (except for the progenitor staining group) for 10 min on ice. The cells were washed, centrifuged, and brilliant stain buffer (Invitrogen) containing antibodies were added (total volume of 50 µl). The sample was then incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark. All data were acquired using a 21-colour CytoFLEX LX (Beckman Coulter). The antibodies used for the myeloid cells panel and progenitor cells panel are listed in Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">5</ref><ref type="table">6</ref><ref type="table">7</ref><ref type="table">8</ref>.</p></div>
